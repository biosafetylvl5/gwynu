#### Spain has a National Health Service (NHS) financed mainly by taxes, which provides universal and free health care coverage [16-18]. Even so, for pharmaceutical products there is a system of cost-sharing whereby the user pays 40% of the cost of medicines prescribed by an NHS doctor. However, for certain groups medicines are free: those in hospital, people who are retired older than 65, disabled or have suffered an occupational accident. Patients with chronic diseases pay 10% (until a fixed quantity of 2,95€ maximum) of the cost of medicines, when these are explicitly prescribed by NHS physicians. For medicines which are either not prescribed, or prescribed by a private doctor, the user pays 100% of the cost [17]. According to Spanish Law, a prescription is required for medicines that present a danger either directly or indirectly to health [19]. But sometimes, Spaniards get and take medicines that need a prescription without having the doctor prescription [20,21]. Regarding non-prescribed drugs, a study conducted in Southern Spain found that 13% of medicines requiring prescription are sold in pharmacies without prescriptions [22

#### the aim of the present study was to describe the use of prescribed and non prescribed medicines in a non-institutionalised population older than 15 years of an urban area during the year 2000, in terms of age and gender, social class, employment status and type of PHC.

#### Persons who did not want to answer the questionnaire (14%) were replaced by another of the same age and sex.

#### Women who only took oral contraceptives or medication for menopause (45 in total, 1.1%) were excluded to permit the comparison of results between sexes. The final sample included 4,216 persons

#### The bivariate analysis shows that more men in advantaged classes and with good health took non-prescribed medicines than men in social classes IV-V (38.7% men in social class I-II and 31.8% in social class IV-V

#### Conversely, the opposite happens among people with poor health: the more disadvantaged classes took more nonprescribed medicines.
