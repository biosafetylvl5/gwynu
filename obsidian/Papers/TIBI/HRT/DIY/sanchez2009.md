> "available data suggest that many transpersons are uninsured and that, overall, a smaller proportion of transpersons than of the general population access medical care. According to a national survey, only 30% to 40% of transgender individuals utilize any regular medical care.3 Indeed, transgender persons may have difficulty identifying competent and compassionate providers with transgender patient experience. Additional obstacles to expertly supervised care might include economic limitations, comorbidities resulting from substance abuse, and stigmatization. As a result of these barriers, transpersons may obtain hormones from nontraditional sources, including friends, street vendors, the Internet, and pharmacists (in the absence of a prescribing physician)." ([Sanchez et al 2009:713](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FYIKXXF9?page=1))

> "The prevalence of unsupervised hormone use reportedly ranges from 29% to 63% within urban groups of male-to-female transgender persons,5,7,8" ([Sanchez et al 2009:713](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FYIKXXF9?page=1))

> "Hormone therapy regimens pose additional health risks to transgender clients, the most serious of which is hypercoagulabilty associated with estrogen administration. The incidence of thromboembolism among male-to-female transgender persons on estrogen therapy ranges from 0.4% to 2.6% per year.10,11 Other documented side effects include depression, mood swings, hyperprolactinemia, elevated liver enzymes, migraines, and decreased insulin sensitivity.6,12 A review of endocrine treatments at Johns Hopkins University found that many clients use high-dose hormone regimens and utilize multiple hormones concurrently without medical supervision in the belief that this will achieve faster results.6" ([Sanchez et al 2009:713](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FYIKXXF9?page=1))

#### METHODS

> "Part 3 assessed the participant's access to, usage of, and problems associated with hormone usage. Participants were allowed to report multiple sources for hormone information and supplies" ([Sanchez et al 2009:714](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FYIKXXF9?page=2))

> "To encourage candid responses regarding high-risk behavior, we did not collect any identifying information. To ensure that respondents participated on only 1 occasion, 1investigator was present for all the interviews. Three surveys were not included in the final analysis because identical demographic data suggested duplication" ([Sanchez et al 2009:714](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FYIKXXF9?page=2))

lmao, they forgot who they already saw ([note on p.714](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FYIKXXF9?page=2))

> "Sociodemographics Self-identified male-to-female transgender individuals (N=101) participated in the survey and were included in the analyses. The mean age of each participant was 37 years and the median age was 36 years (range=18-67 years Table 1). Among male-to-female transgender persons, 80% were currently living as women, 82% were current or past users of hormone therapy, 70% reported current hormone use, and 22% had undergone gender reassignment or breast surgery; 79% were non-White, and 21% of the sample was foreign born. Approximately half of the participants reported some education beyond high school; 28% of participants did not complete high school. Forty-one percent reported not earning enough money to pay for daily living expenses such as rent or food, and 45% of participants lived in someone else's home or relied on shelter placement." ([Sanchez et al 2009:714](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FYIKXXF9?page=2))

> "Twenty-eight percent reported a source of income exclusively "on the books." Half of all participants reported current tobacco use. Overall, transpersons without any current health care provider were statistically more likely than were participants with provider access to be foreign born, lack health insurance, be unable to pay for daily living expenses, live in someone else's home or in a shelter, and smoke cigarettes" ([Sanchez et al 2009:715](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FYIKXXF9?page=3))

> "male-to-female transgender persons who lacked stable housing (P=.012) were less likely than their counterparts to have access to a general practitioner or mental health professional" ([Sanchez et al 2009:715](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FYIKXXF9?page=3))

> "Access to a provider knowledgeable about transgender health issues was the most reported barrier to care (32%) followed by access to a transgender-friendly provider (30%), cost (29%), access to a specialist (28%), location (18%), and language (13%; Table 2). Access to a knowledgeable provider about transgender health issues did not vary with provider group, indicating that this barrier persists despite improved access to care" ([Sanchez et al 2009:715](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FYIKXXF9?page=3))

> "Lack of current medical care (n=9), cost of hormones (n=8), and physician refusal to prescribe (n=6) were also reported as reasons for not taking hormones" ([Sanchez et al 2009:716](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FYIKXXF9?page=4))

> "Among the 71 individuals on hormones, 79% (n=56) listed a physician as 1 source of hormone distribution. Twenty-three percent (n=16) obtained hormones from a source that did not include a physician. Among the 56 individuals who obtained hormones from a licensed physician, 5 reported purchasing hormones from other sources to supplement their prescription regimen. Participants lacking a health care provider were more likely to obtain hormones from nontraditional sources, including friends (P=.003) and street vendors (P=.003), than were those with a health care provider. Participants with access to health care providers were more likely to access hormones from a general practitioner (P<.001) than were those without access to health care providers" ([Sanchez et al 2009:716](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FYIKXXF9?page=4))

> "Male-to-female transgender persons who lacked medical care access were more likely to be dissatisfied with their ability to obtain hormone therapy (P=.001) and with the results of their regimen (P=.036" ([Sanchez et al 2009:716](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FYIKXXF9?page=4))

> "Two cases of thromboembolic disease were reported. One participant who was using hormones without medical supervision reported a deep vein thrombosis" ([Sanchez et al 2009:716](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FYIKXXF9?page=4))

> "even among participants who reported access to both a general practitioner and mental health professional, difficulty identifying a provider knowledgeable about transgender health concerns was reported as a concern." ([Sanchez et al 2009:717](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FYIKXXF9?page=5))

> "The perception that health care providers lack necessary expertise to supervise hormone therapy, along with the wish to maximize and accelerate feminization, may at least partially account for the utilization of hormones from multiple and nontraditional sources" ([Sanchez et al 2009:717](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FYIKXXF9?page=5))

> "Our sample may not represent male-to-female transgender persons in general. Respondents were recruited in New York City, mostly at sites serving non-White, low-income clients" ([Sanchez et al 2009:718](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FYIKXXF9?page=6))
