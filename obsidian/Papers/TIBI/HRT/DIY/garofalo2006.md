# Overlooked, misunderstood and at-risk: exploring the lives and HIV risk of ethnic minority male-to-female transgender youth

#### A convenience sample (n 51) of ethnic-minority MTF transgender youth aged 16 -25 years completed an anonymous questionnaire including demographics, psychosocial measures, and participation in substance use and sexual risk behaviors. Descriptive analyses and analyses of association were used to interpret the data

#### Participants were a convenience sample (n 51) of self-identified ethnic minority MTF transgender youth aged 16 -25 years recruited over a 4-month period in the Spring of 2003 from community-based organizations serving transgender youth and advertisements in social venues frequented by transgenders

#### A Transgender Youth Working Group (TYWG) composed of key constituents from six community agencies met regularly for six months to develop the survey and create study procedures.

#### To ensure the survey was culturally appropriate, MTF transgender youth provided direct input to the TYWG

#### The survey required approximately 35 minutes to complete and participants received $25.

#### The SSAS has been used in urban youth with a Cronbach alpha of .80; our sample's alpha was .85

#### Qualitative information. During a brief exit interview, informal open-ended questions developed by the TYWG allowed youth to elaborate on feelings regarding research participation, personal experiences, and HIV and prevention activities

#### Although virtually all (n 50) participants reported having sex with other men, with regards to sexual orientation, 47% considered themselves to be homosexual, 26% heterosexual, and 16% bisexual.

#### Self-esteem. Participant's mean score on the RSES was 21.5 (range: 9 -30); within the general population's normal range of 15-25

#### Where do you get hormones? (n 31) Doctor or other medical provider 9 (29%) Friends 15 (48%) Internet 1 (3%) Other 6 (19%)

#### Sixty-one percent of participants reported using feminizing hormones (i.e., estrogen), but only 29% got hormones from a medical provider

#### Qualitative comments were offered by 80% of youth during the brief exit interview. Regarding research participation, all responding youth stated having a positive experience and many reported hoping it might improve understanding of their community

#### Of course I am worried that I might get it [HIV]. But it seems to be all people talk about

#### Preventing HIV in us girls is complicated. We need jobs, places to stay, doctors. HIV is just one of the many problems we deal with

#### More than 20% of the sample cited experiencing discrimination from medical and social services agencies insensitive to transgender issues (e.g., being critical about appearances, using male personal pronouns instead of female, or asking for their "real name")

#### Although participants reported selfesteem and depression scores similar to the general population, many cited limited social support from parents or siblings. Familial conflict can lead to homelessness, as was reported by 18% of our sample. Highlighting that housing difficulties were common among MTF transgender youth, 46% reported difficulty finding safe places to sleep. Housing struggles among transgender youth are further complicated by discrimination based upon female gender identity or presentation

#### Although few participants injected traditional drugs, injection hormone use and injection silicone to manipulate and feminize physical appearance were common. The majority of participants using feminizing hormones obtained them from nonmedical providers, and the health consequences (mood swings, hepatic disease, thromboembolic disease, etc.) of hormone use in transgender youth have not yet been fully explored [2].
