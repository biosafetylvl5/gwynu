Social network analysis revealed that transgender women with a greater number of hormone-using network alters were most likely to misuse hormones, but that using the Internet to find transgender friends mitigated this association.

#### and high-risk sexual activity has been associated with worse health outcomes, including HIV infection and non-prescribed hormone use (Kurtz, Surratt, Kiley, & Inciardi, 2005; Nemoto, Bodeker, & Iwamoto, 2011).

> "However, due to economic hardship and experiences of healthcare-related stigma (Grantetal.,2011;Jamesetal.,2016;WhiteHughto,Murchison, Clark, Pachankis, & Reisner, 2016), trans women are much less likelytoaccessmedicalcarethanthegeneralpopulation,often leading them to obtain hormones from non-medical sources (Rotondi et al., 2013). Even trans women who do access medical care canbedeniedhormones:The2015U.S.TransgenderSurvey(hereafter, USTS), a convenience sample of over 27,000 transgender people,foundthat25%oftransgenderindividualswhoattempted to access hormones were denied insurance coverage for transition-related hormone therapy (James et al., 2016)." ([Clark et al 2018:955](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KYS5ILB8?page=3))

> "Widespread non-prescribed hormone use among transwomen has been documented across numerous U.S. studies (Bradford etal.,2013;Garofalo,Deleon,Osmer,Doll,&Harper,2006; Xavier,Bobbin,Singer,&Budd,2005).AstudyfromNewYork Cityinvestigatingbarrierstocareandhormoneusageamongtrans women(N=101)foundthat23%ofhormoneuserswereaccessinghormonesfromasourcethatdidnotincludeaphysician,including friends, lovers, and street vendors (Sanchez, Sanchez, & Danoff, 2009). While hormone use is associated with an increase in generalqualityoflifeamongtranswomen(WhiteHughto&Reisner,2016),itisalsoassociatedwithnumeroushealthrisks,the most serious of which is venous thromboembolism (VTE) (Asscheman etal.,2014).Administrationofethinylestradiol(i.e.,oralestrogen) isassociatedwith6-8%incidenceofVTEamongtranswomenand is thus no longer prescribed by most clinics (Gooren, Giltay, & Bunck, 2008). However, trans women who use non-prescribed hormonesoftenuseexcessdosingoforalcontraceptivescontaining ethinyl estradiol (Asscheman et al., 2014), posing a major health risk. Other reported hormone side effects include elevated liver enzymes,gallstones,decreaseinhemoglobin,anddepression (Moore,Wisniewski,&Dobs,2003).Transwomenmayalsoaffirm theirgenderbyfeminizingtheirappearancethroughinjectionofsoft tissue"fillers"suchasoils,industrialsilicones,cementglue,andautomobile fluid (Poteat et al., 2015; Wilson, Rapues, Jin, & Raymond, 2014), which can result in serious complications, including blood clots, pulmonary hemorrhage, pneumonitis, loss of limb(s), and death (Styperek, Bayers, Beer, & Beer, 2013)."

#### Structural Inequities Among Trans Women: Income, Housing, and Health Insurance

> "While it is known that social support acts as a buffer against mental health issues, limited research has investigated the role of trans women's social networks in understanding health and riskbehaviors.Socialnetworkanalysisinvolvingtranswomen has been limited in application: One study showed that trans women with larger social networks were more socially and politically active (Lombardi, 1999), while another highlighted that trans women's networks were more homophilous than the lesbian,gay,bisexual,andcisgendercounterparts(Barrington, Wejnert,Guardado,Nieto,&Bailey,2012).Further,littleattention has been paid to how trans women form social networks with trans friends. A qualitative research study (N = 20) from New York City found that low income, African-American/ Black,and Hispanic/Latinatrans women who sought care at a community-basedclinicformedsocialnetworkswithothertrans women from the clinic, which led to social support and genderfocused activism (Pinto, Melendez, & Spector, 2008). Another small qualitative study (N =10) found that, among a social network of trans activists, the Internet served as the best forum for which to connect with each other (Shapiro, 2004). The Internet, in particular, has been an important venue for social support and networkformationamongLGBpopulations(Baamsetal.,2011; Mehra, Merkel, & Bishop, 2004); however, its application to trans networks has, to our knowledge, not been explored" ([Clark et al 2018:956](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KYS5ILB8?page=4))

Given thecurrentliterature, itwas hypothesizedthatamong trans women: (1) structural barriers to healthcare would negatively impact hormone use and (2) social network homophily related to hormone use (i.e., more individuals in one's network use hormones) would lead to greater risk of hormone misuse" ([Clark et al 2018:956](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KYS5ILB8?page=4))
