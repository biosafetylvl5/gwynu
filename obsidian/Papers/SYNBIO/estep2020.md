## SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) vaccine Rapid Deployment Vaccine Collaborative (RaDVaC) Preston Estep, Don Wang, Alex Hoekstra, Ranjan Ahuja, George Church, Brian Delaney, and over 100 others

### Summary of key general features of a citizen-science vaccine: 
- Safe ingredients. Long history of published results. 
- Ease and robustness of production. Simple to make but with the possible tradeoff of short stability. Chitosan nanoparticles form spontaneously and reproducibly, over a wide range of conditions and ingredient concentrations. 
- Intranasal delivery. The preferred delivery mode for respiratory and nasal viruses. Highest safety profile. Potentially stimulates both protective mucosal immunity at the site of infection, and systemic immunity. 
- Peptide epitope antigens. Short peptides of linear epitopes are easiest to procure or produce, and are predicted to function best without specific structural constraints. These can be mined from a rich literature, or produced de novo. Antigens for incorporation into a vaccine can be produced synthetically or as recombinant expression proteins. 
- Booster schedule. Allows use of intranasal delivery and a lower dose or milder adjuvant, yet has the potential to produce immune responses equivalent to a single dose of hyper-stimulatory adjuvants

### Vaccine Design & Differences from Commercial Offerings

> "For example, as of mid August, 2020 our most recent vaccine designs incorporate key discoveries about critical determinants of T-cell mediated immunity, which were published in the biomedical literature only weeks before. One important discovery shows that T-cell responses are found in patients almost two decades after recovery from SARS-CoV-1 (a very closely related coronavirus) . The  portions of the virus responsible for these very long-lived T-cell responses (CD4 and CD8) are in highly conserved parts of the virus. They are not present in the Spike protein, which is not highly conserved, and which is the primary target of leading vaccines in the race to commercialization" ([Estep et al 2020:76](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34E9IEDH?page=8))

> "Near-term safety of the intranasal vaccine described here should be excellent when prepared appropriately. Intranasal vaccines have a long history of demonstrated safety. The vaccine formulations described here can also be used for other delivery routes, including inhalation, oral, or parenteral delivery (injection), but these, especially the latter, should be attempted only by skilled practitioners. In general, a vaccine is more safely used for inhalation into the lungs , oral, or intranasal delivery, than  for injection. This document is focused on intranasal delivery, but experts will know how to adapt the information herein to another delivery route" ([Estep et al 2020:76](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34E9IEDH?page=8))

> "The primary reason for using strong adjuvants in commercial vaccines is to trigger a robust immune response with a single administration, avoiding a booster schedule" ([Estep et al 2020:77](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34E9IEDH?page=9))

> "Importantly, it can elicit not only systemic immunity, but also mucosal immunity at the point of infection for respiratory viruses." ([Estep et al 2020:78](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34E9IEDH?page=10))

> "**As of 17 June 2020, most or all commercial SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development are designed to be injected (parenteral), a route which is unlikely to provide mucosal immunity to infection**"

#### but to achieve this level of immune response and protection--especially with milder adjuvants--multiple doses are often required

#### Given the above key points, it is clear that a rapid-deployment vaccine that is both safe and effective is likely to have multiple attributes that differentiate it from a commercial vaccine. And it becomes clear why the formulation described here has not been used in a commercial product; it is not lack of safety or efficacy, but other factors

> "Commercial vaccines are designed to produce high levels of immunity with a single dose. A prime and multi-boost schedule is used routinely in the research setting, but concerns about compliance (failure to boost) limit commercial deployment" ([Estep et al 2020:79](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34E9IEDH?page=11))

> "Vaccines against other pathogens that similarly use full-length 24 constructs have also elicited enhancement of viral sensitivity or disease" ([Estep et al 2020:80](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34E9IEDH?page=12))

#### One challenge for intranasal vaccines is verifying efficacy

#### Many published reports show that nasally delivered vaccines have high efficacy for prevention of infection, typically equivalent or superior to injected vaccines for this most important measure. However, efficacy is not as easily measured or predicted by traditional measures, such as anti-virus or anti-epitope antibody titer (e.g. as measured by ELISA) in serum. This is in part because blood is more quantifiable than mucosal secretions, and in part because the primary means of conferring immunity is through mucosal stimulation and response

> "there isn't a single accepted or proven mechanism known to cause or contribute to VED, there are historical vaccine design features and adjuvant factors that are suspected contributors" ([Estep et al 2020:86](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34E9IEDH?page=18))

> "One possible contributing factor in this process is a phenomenon referred to as "original antigenic sin." Exposure to an initial antigen produces memory immune cells that recognize the amino acid sequence of this antigen, and upon" ([Estep et al 2020:86](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34E9IEDH?page=18))

> "subsequent exposure to a related but slightly different antigen, there is preferential expansion of memory cells that recognize the original antigen rather than cells that recognize and bind more tightly to the second antigen.  Thus, upon second infection, the antibody response is directed  mostly at epitopes of the previous infection, and less robustly against the current infection. Original antigenic sin is not limited to B-cell epitopes, and essentially the same phenomenon has been reported for T-cell epitopes and responses" ([Estep et al 2020:87](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34E9IEDH?page=19))

> "The vaccine is very simple and consists of five ingredients: epitope peptide(s), chitosan, sodium triphosphate, water, and sodium chloride" ([Estep et al 2020:94](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34E9IEDH?page=26))

> "We have used 50 micrograms to 100 micrograms 135 total peptide for the initial priming and boost doses. Typical doses have been in the range of 70 micrograms" ([Estep et al 2020:121](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34E9IEDH?page=53))

> "The vaccine should be used at least 3 times (as shown by animal studies and human clinical trial data): a priming dose, and administration of 2+ booster doses." ([Estep et al 2020:121](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34E9IEDH?page=53))

> "Ideally, doses are spaced by 1 week or more. Given the seriousness of the pandemic and individual circumstances, even shorter intervals between boosters might be used" ([Estep et al 2020:121](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34E9IEDH?page=53))

> "Dozens of RaDVaC testers have self-administered 4+ doses of progressive generations of vaccine, spaced by 1+ week each" ([Estep et al 2020:121](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/34E9IEDH?page=53))
