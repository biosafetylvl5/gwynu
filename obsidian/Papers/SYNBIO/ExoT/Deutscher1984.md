**This paper discovered the existence of  Exonuclease T in *E. coli* and named it "RNAse T" at the time because of it's (then hypothesized) role in tRNA turnover.**

It was found that, with a base substrate of tRNA-CCA, Exonuclease T:

- is an exonuclease that acts on tRNA
- had a pH optimum in the range of pH 8-9
- required Mg2+, Mn2+, or Co2+ with Mg2+ in the range of 3-10mM being best. 
- is strongly inhibited by salts at ionic strengths in excess of
50 mM
- is very sensitive to heat inactivation, losing half of its activity in 7 min at 45C
- digests in a random fashion
- initiated attack at the 3' terminus, requiring a free 3' hydroxyl group
- exhibited substrate sensitivity with:
	+ CTP cleavage 10% of that of ATP
	+ UTP cleavage was much slower than that of ATP
	+ Both tRNA-CC and tRNA-CCACC demonstrating reduced acitivity relative to tRNA-CCA
- it was found that Poly(A) was inactive as a substrate
