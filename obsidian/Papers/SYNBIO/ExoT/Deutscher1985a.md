This paper purified Exonuclease T as discovered in [[Deutscher1984]] and did more characterization *in vitro*.

It was newly found that Exonuclease T:

- is an $alpha_2$ dimer with a monomer weight of 25kDa
- has a $K_m$ of 14$\mu$M for total tRNA which was notably low for an enzyme that binds DNA during catalysis
- exclusively hydrolyses the 3' end and does not act on the 5' end of RNA
- is extremely sensitive to:
	+ oxidation:
		* "we repeatedly observed loss of enzyme activity which could be reversed almost completely by incubation with the reducing agent. This problem could be eliminated by maintaining RNase T in 10-fold higher levels of dithiothreitol"
	+ sulfhydryl group reagents:
		* " agreement with its sensitivity to oxidation (see above), RNase T is also rapidly inactivated by a variety of reagents which react with sulfhydryl groups. In two cases, that of p-hydroxymercuribenzoate andmercuric chloride,the inactivation could be reversed by incubation with high concentrations of dithiothreitol. These data indicate that RNase T contains one or more sulfhydryl groups that are important for the catalytic activity and/or the structure of this enzyme."
- is mildly sensitive to ionic strengths:
	+ "Fifty per cent inhibition was observed at 100 mM KCl, and essentially complete inhibition was found at 250 mM KCl."
- maintains 80-90% of activity for at least 6 month when stored at -20C
- is sensitive to dilution, but it's hypothesized that bovine serum albumin stabilizes this type of inactivation
- acts on tRNA-CC at 1% of the rate of tRNA-CCA terminal hydrolysis

Further, previous attributes of Exonuclease T were characterized more fully:

- in addition to a pH of 8-9 being optimal, Exonuclease T exhibits 50% of optimal activity at pHs of 7.2 and 9.6
- the reported optimal cation concentration was futher elaborated on:
    + the optimal Mg2+ concentration changed from 3-10mM to 2-5mM
    + the optimal Mn2+ concentration was reported as 1mM
- the activity associated with Co2+ at 2-10mM was  found result in 20% of the activity associated with optimal Mg2+ concentration
- it was found that Cu2+, Zn2+, Ba2+, Ca2+, CdZ+, and Hg2+ displayed no activity at either 1 or 5 mM
- the temperature sensitivity was further quantified
	+ "RNase T is extremely sensitive to temperature inactivation, losing as much as 80% of its activity in a 5-min preincubation in buffer A at 37 "C, and 90% in 20 min at this temperature. The presence of 1 M KC1 could protect theenzyme against this inactivation, with only 15% of RNase T activity being lost in 5min under these conditions and 25% in 20 min. tRNA also afforded some protection with a loss of 35% of the activity in 5 min, although by 20 min RNaseT was 85% inactivated."
