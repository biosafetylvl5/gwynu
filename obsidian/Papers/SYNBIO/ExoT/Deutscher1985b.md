This paper presented evidence to support a hypothesis that Exonuclease T (as discovered in [[Deutscher1984]]) plays a role in RNA turnover by removing terminal adenosine residues. This proccess is counter to the (then) currently understood mechanism of tRNA transferase and results in a (then) yet to be understood cycle of addition and removal: "At first glance, this seems to be a futile cycle." Double mutants with a deficiancy of both tRNA nucleotidyltransferase and exonuclease T had their growth speed *mostly* restored.
