New to me (and to most americans I’ve talked to) blood has been used in cooking forever. I write about anemia and iron consumption and how consuming blood-based baked goods might be a better idea that it may initally seem. In a moment of existential crisis, I thought about the ethics/justification for consuming blood which I also include here. I have also assembled a small collection of historical / traditional recipies that use blood along with a list of all the contemporary recipies I’ve stumbled upon. Finaly, I include some notes on sourcing, storage and a botched carbon monoxide treatment.</p><nav class=table-of-contents><ol><li><a href=#sanguinaccio-dolce>Sanguinaccio dolce</a></li><li><a href=#recipes>Recipes</a><ol><li><a href=#blood-crepes>Blood Crepes</a></li><li><a href=#blood-banana-bread>Blood Banana Bread</a></li><li><a href=#sanguinaccio-dolce-(blood-pudding)>Sanguinaccio Dolce (Blood Pudding)</a></li><li><a href=#fruity-sanguinaccio-dolce>Fruity Sanguinaccio Dolce</a></li></ol></li><li><a href=#ethics-of-blood-consumption>Ethics of Blood Consumption</a><ol><li><a href=#jamie-vulva>Jamie Vulva</a><ol><li><a href=#menstrual-fluid-cookies>Menstrual Fluid Cookies</a></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><a href=#assorted-notes>Assorted Notes</a><ol><li><a href=#handling>Handling</a></li><li><a href=#cook-time>Cook Time</a></li><li><a href=#removing-clots>Removing Clots</a></li><li><a href=#portioning>Portioning</a></li><li><a href=#defrosting>Defrosting</a></li><li><a href=#sourcing>Sourcing</a></li><li><a href=#carbon-monoxide%3A-maintaining-that-boyish-pink>Carbon Monoxide: Maintaining that Boyish Pink</a></li></ol></li><li><a href=#recipes-(failures)>Recipes (Failures)</a><ol><li><a href=#blood-molasses-cookies>Blood Molasses Cookies</a></li><li><a href=#lemon-blood-curd-(2%2F16%2F20)>Lemon Blood Curd (2/16/20)</a></li><li><a href=#blood-merange>Blood Merange</a></li></ol></li><li><a href=#recipie-archive>Recipie Archive</a><ol><li><a href=#contemporary-(2000s-onwards)>Contemporary (2000s onwards)</a><ol><li><a href=#hungarian-fried-blood>Hungarian Fried Blood</a></li><li><a href=#swedish-blodpudding>Swedish Blodpudding</a></li><li><a href=#blood-puddings-(dessert)>Blood Puddings (Dessert)</a><ol><li><a href=#sanguinaccio-dolce-by-samuel-(2018)>Sanguinaccio Dolce by Samuel (2018)</a></li><li><a href=#blood-pudding-by-chris-young-(2014)>Blood Pudding by Chris Young (2014)</a></li><li><a href=#sanguinaccio-dolce-by-peter-bella>Sanguinaccio Dolce by Peter Bella</a></li><li><a href=#sanguinaccio-dolce-by-mister-meatball-(2012)>Sanguinaccio Dolce by Mister Meatball (2012)</a></li></ol></li><li><a href=#paltbr%C3%B6d-(2008)>Paltbröd (2008)</a></li></ol></li><li><a href=#historical-(pre-2000s)>Historical (Pre-2000s)</a><ol><li><a href=#pasta-al-sangue>Pasta al Sangue</a></li><li><a href=#pig%E2%80%99s-blood-cake>Pig’s Blood Cake</a></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></nav><blockquote><p>The identity ‘vampire’ means little to nothing to us.

A classic Neapolitan dessert, with almond milk. Easy on the stomach. Blood and chocolate. That should’ve been the subtitle of my book.” - Hannibal, The Great Red Dragon [S03E08]</p></blockquote><p>Sanguinnacio dolce is a simple dish, with only four key ingridients: milk, sugar, chocolate and blood. Unsurprisingly, blood is the hardest to aquire now-a-days. It needing to be cooked or frozen quickly after slaughter means that sanguinnacio dolce, a once popular Southern Italian signature dish is now restricted to those with easy access to livestock.</p><p>After calling a number of famers, I <a href=#sourcing>managed to aquire</a> roughly half of a gallon of fresh pigs blood. Starting with a recipie from <a href=http://www.emikodavies.com/blog/blood-chocolate-sanguinaccio/ >Emiko Davies</a>, I gave sanguinnacio dolce my first shot.</p><p>It was, I must say, not good. The final result was slightly grainy and had a very iron heavy flavour profile. Working with the blood brought up feelings similar to the first time I cooked with meat, definitly a high “eww” factor.</p><p>Working with the blood more eliminated the quisiness and adjusting the ingridient ratios fixed the flavour profile. The texture was fixed by changing the order of ingridiant addition (milk &amp; chocolate first until melted, <em>then</em> add the blood). All in all, I had a wonderful dessert, a lot of blood and a ever increasing interest in incorporating blood into food.</p><figure><img src=poon-feeding-hannibal-s03e08-sanguinnacio.png alt=""><figcaption>Hannibals sanguinaccio with Ladyfinger biscuits and fresh berries <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20200614221041/http://janicepoonart.blogspot.com/2015/07/episode-8-great-red-dragon.html>Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>In the TV show, Hannibal uses almond milk, whole cloves, bovine blood and what appears to be dark chocolate.

I made these cookies last December and there have been people chipping on the internet about them ever since. This is the <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805051233/http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/y2roz/girl_collects_menstrual_blood_in_jar_uses_it_to/ >second time they’ve been posted on reddit</a> (the first time it got buried, and that’s totally fine). I figured I’d make a vlog, just explaining everything because a lot of people are making assumptions and have some false ideas about blood and how it works. I don’t want that. I will start by saying that the cookies are made with real blood. There are 5 tablespoons of blood in the cookie recipe. They’re made with fresh blood from the most recent cycle in December. I made them immediately after I was finished bleeding and collecting blood and all that. There have been lot of questions about the color of the cookies.</p><p>(01:25): They’re like red velvet looking almost. And that’s because I added some neon pink food coloring to balance out the, the browning that would occur with the blood. I didn’t want to make a gross looking cookie. I wanted them to be like aesthetically pleasing. There have been some remarks about clotting. There were clots in that five tablespoons. I don’t pass a lot of clots, but there were some in there. When I mixed the batter, they just kind of dispersed. There’s also been people talking about coagulation and about how blood coaggulates immediately. Menstrual blood is a little different. Menstrual blood is actually an incorrect, I wouldn’t say it’s necessarily incorrect, but it’s not quite the right descriptor because what we pass is not blood. There’s blood in it, but it’s best described as menstrual fluid.</p><p>(02:38): It’s made up of uterine lining, cervical mucus and vaginal secretions as well as like water and all kinds of other stuff. There’s absolutely blood in there, but it does not make up the majority of what is in menstrual fluid. It’s just what makes it red. There’s also this “enzyme thing” in in the uterine lining called plasmin that prevents the blood from clotting - or coagulating, sorry, excuse me, we pass clots. That’s why it doesn’t coagulate and get all gross on our bodies as we pass it. Which is really wonderful because that would be horrible. It works a little bit differently than most people think because when most people think of blood, they think “coagulation” which doesn’t make sense.</p><p>(03:50): Menstrual fluid or menstrual blood aren’t like regular blood. I feel like I need to also communicate that my blood jar and the blood cookies are two completely separate things. I have a blood jar that I started filling in 2009. I haven’t collected in over six months just because I haven’t really felt like it. But that is the jar that’s pictured. I would not use that in any sort of baking ingredient. I don’t even open it in the house. I wear a mask when I open it. It smells terrible and it’s horrible for you to breathe in those fumes. I would never try to feed that to somebody; that could very well be lethal.</p><p>(05:06): So yeah, the cookies are made with fresh blood. I want that to be clear, fresh blood, not old blood. I’m not trying to kill anybody. I started collecting my blood in order to monitor how much how much blood I was losing, because I’ve always been a heavy bleeder. I had my son and I started bleeding even more. And then I got a Paraguard copper IUD and one of the side effects of that is having heavier periods. Most women bleed like between two to six tablespoons. I usually lose about three quarters of a cup which is a lot. That was why I started collecting - I wouldn’t have know that otherwise. I was just like: there’s like blood everywhere, all the time.</p><p>(06:12): I can’t keep up with this. Oh my God. What is happening? So yeah, I started collecting my blood because of that. It sits in a jar in my bathroom. Like I said, I don’t really open it very often. I only really open it when I’m adding to it and that hasn’t been in a while. Usually keep aseparate, smaller jar that I’ll add to for a bit, because I don’t like to open the main jar very often. So I’ll keep one in the fridge and add to it for awhile. And then once it gets close to being full, I’ll transfer the contents to the big jar.</p><p>(06:58): How do I collect the blood? I use my diva cap. It’s just a little silicone cup that goes inside your vagina. Your cervix sits in the cup and it drips [makes dripping sounds] into the cup. Then you pull it out and dump it. I dump it into a jar. Otherwise it just goes into the toilet. Really cool. They’re super environmentally friendly and fairly inexpensive in the grand scheme of sanitary products. I made the cookies as a gift for somebody. They never received the cookies because I didn’t like how it turned out. But originally, they were made as a gift for somebody whom I knew would appreciate them.</p><p>(08:21): I didn’t make them as any sort of feminist statement or anything like that. They’re just an idea that I had and I’m the kind of person who’s like: “Why not make these? I have the means to do it. It could be really interesting and cool.” Granted, it’s kind of a weird thing to do, but they’re just cookies. If you really think about it, it’s just my unfertilized reproductive cycle. What do you think eggs are? Exactly. That is that just out of a chicken. It wasn’t anything crazy. It was just an idea that I had. So I did it. A lot of people think I like did it for attention or whatever, and I didn’t. Sometimes people do weird stuff and I think that’s that’s okay.</p><p>(09:34): And that should be embraced not demonized. [sighs] Did I eat them? I didn’t really. I had a bite of one just to see what it tasted like - that way I knew what I theoretically was going to give to this person. And that’s how I knew I was unhappy with the cookies. The whole idea of eating my menstrual blood, isn’t very appealing to me. I don’t really like the taste of blood in the first place. And granted, I understand it would be completely different than when baked into a cookie. I just don’t like the taste of it. Nor do I have any desire eat my menstrual fluid. So yeah, I had one bite of them. And then I kept them around for awhile and debated giving them to the person who ordered them because they said that they still wanted them, even though I wasn’t happy with the way they turned out. But ultimately, I decided I would rather make them another batch later on.</p><p>(10:53): There’s some people commenting on the fact that I’m vegan and that I made cookies. This is really simple to understand because consensually I’m consensually giving my blood to somebody who is consensually eating my blood (or rather, would have conceptually eaten my blood). And that’s no different than kissing somebody or breastfeeding or oral sex. Anything, anything like that. It’s all on the same. You’re just consensually ingesting another person’s fluids. It’s not like the norm, but I don’t think it’s all that strange. I get that putting them in cookies is a little bit weird, but I don’t think it makes me horribly disgusting or a bad person or anything like that. I think it just makes me adventurous and maybe a little bit creative. It’s fine if you don’t view it that way, or if you think I need Jesus or I’m horribly disgusting or whatever. You don’t have to be my friend. You don’t have to eat my cookies. I’m the only one who tasted them. Nobody else did.</p><p>(12:26): Anyway, this video is too long, so I’m going to stop now.</p><h2 id=assorted-notes>Assorted Notes</h2><h3 id=handling>Handling</h3><h3 id=cook-time>Cook Time</h3><p>It’s often hard to know when things are done, as the blood turns a deep brown when heated.

I find that straining the blood is much more convenient, and allows me to strain directly into a weighing dish as not to waste blood in the blender. It also has the upside of not needing to clean a blender.</p><figure><img src=./blood/pics/20200229-staining-blood.jpg alt=""><figcaption>Recipie testers straining blood</figcaption></figure><h3 id=portioning>Portioning</h3><p>Instead of freezing large batches, I recommend freezing in ice cube trays - measuring out so each blood cube (aka a <em>blube</em>) is 43g (one egg white equivalent).

(I’ve left his name out for privacy/legal reasons.) However, other people seem to have had better luck than me in finding someone willing to sell them blood, so your mileage may vary.</p><figure><img src=./blood/pics/original-blood-dithered.png alt=""><figcaption>Blood in a pail of ice, next to a larger pail of ice that was used for transport.

The glassware available to me at this point was minimal due to SARS-CoV-2 induce lab closures and so I was using the cold trap instead of a more suitable substitute. The cold trap was nessesary as the carbon monoxide produced was hot enough to cook the blood on contact. When stopping this reaction I was quite tired (it was well past midnight) and I removed the reaction flask from the heat without venting the system to atmosphere. This caused a vacuum and ended up pulling water from the cold trap (which was there to dissolve any excess sulphuric/formic acid vapour given off by the reaction) up and into the reaction flask. The water quickly boiled and blew the stopper off of the flask thus releasing enough carbon monoxide into the fume hood that I was worried for my safety.</p><figure><img src=./blood/pics/2020-03-09_messenger.png alt=""><figcaption>Messenger texts about me possibly being poisoned</figcaption></figure><p>My symptoms for the next 24 hours lead me to belive that I was only in the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide_poisoning#Acute_poisoning>200-400ppm zone</a>.
