/u/FloppyKitties asked:

How does diet affect the flavor, from your experience? Do you have a preference for certain people's blood over others? Sorry, I'm so fascinated.

Just generally healthy and well hydrated is great. Fruit makes the blood sweet. Poor diet might make the blood overly salty, and if they've eaten recently, it might be a bit fattier. I've only ever tasted one guy who has really weird and bad tasting blood, but he smokes a lot and his diet isn't overly unhealthy, just very strange. Like, he'd eat a whole head of broccoli dunked in sour cream. TMI warning: His cum tasted absolutely awful too, extremely bitter. I think he's just a weird outlier.

Honestly, the method of storage matters more to the flavour than who it's from and what they eat. Even bad blood is still pretty good. Aside from that one guy.

<p>The identity ‘vampire’ means little to nothing to us. However, when we are blood drinkers, the label is impossible to shake – <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20151021-the-people-who-drink-human-blood">CJ!, blood-drinker</a></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In what started out as an attempt to replicate the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgJY0jPspMw">Sanguinaccio Dolce</a> from the TV Show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_(TV_series)">Hannibal</a>, I’ve learned a lot about cooking with blood and I’ve done my best to document that. New to me (and to most americans I’ve talked to) blood has been used in cooking forever, I also have made a small collection of historical / traditional recipies that use blood. In a moment of existential crisis, I thought about the ethics/justification for consuming blood which I also include here. Finaly, I write about sourcing, storage and a botched carbon monoxide treatment.</p>
<h2 id="but-does-it-taste-good%3F">But does it Taste Good?</h2>
<p>In short, yes. For many of the recipies people couldn’t tell they were eating blood. Even when I told them their was a “weird” ingridient, no one has sucessfully guessed blood yet.</p>
<p>That said, too much blood is <em>not</em> a good thing. Especially in baked goods. There was definitely a learning curve to figuring out how much blood each dish could “handle.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel like this bread would taste good if I made bread with way too much blood and then I made this. It would definitely be better than the bread with way too much blood! [Mei-lan]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-gross-factor">The Gross Factor</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“these taste experiments in the field made us reflect on how crucial it is to not forget about all the “normal people” out there. Whether it’s about them having different tastes or a less-strong attraction to the new and unusual compared to the people in our immediate surroundings is a big question worth thinking about. What is usual here at the Lab is often weird and disgusting for many folks out there. Doing what we do is exciting and fun, at times both dippy and inspiring – but if we fail to reach out and convince others unlike us to at least give some of these foods a try, what is the point in the long run?” - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200419022305/http://nordicfoodlab.org/blog/2014/2/a-side-of-bee-larva-with-your-afternoon-coffee">A side of bee larva with your afternoon coffee?</a> by Edith Salminen at Nordic Food Labs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar to the first few times I handled raw meat, my initial encountors working with blood were slightly nauseating. That feeling quickly faded, but elephant in the room can’t be ignored. The Gross Factor™ is definitely something that was on the mind of many of my recipie and taste testers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I was really expecting to be grossed out, but then it was… fine. I thought it’d be thick but it wasn’t. It was just like cooking with wine” - Alex, a recipe tester</p>

<p>Blood. It’s in meat, many people eat it all the time. And yet, for many the thought of eating something where blood upstages meat triggers a visceral discussed response. I tackle this problem continually in the recipes above, many of the ingredients and techniques are employed in an attempt to downplay or soft and the taste of blood. Why is this so? Why do we not like blood?</p>

<h4 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>3 Tbs Unsalted Butter</li>
<li>2 Large Egg Yolks</li>
<li>1 1/6 Cup Milk (Whole is best)</li>
<li>1/3 cup Dark Brown Sugar</li>
<li>1 Tbs Vanilla</li>
<li>1 cup Flour</li>
<li>86g Pigs Blood, frozen is fine (Salted)</li>
<li>1/2 Tsp. Cinnamon</li>
<li>1 Tsp. Nutmeg</li>
<li>1/2 Tsp. Ground Cloves</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="recipe-preparation">Recipe Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Melt butter in crepe skillet over medium heat. Routinely stir to get browned bits off the bottom of the pan. When butter is light amber colored, add Cinnamon, Nutmeg and Ground Cloves. Stir to combine and remove from heat
<ol>
<li>[why] Brown butter (aka <em>buerre noisette</em>) is made by heating butter to 120C. Since the water has already boiled off (we’re above 100C), the milk solids in butter brown (al a maillard reaction)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>. What’s left after is an amber liquid with suspended dark solids that has a nutty aroma and taste. We add our Cinnamon, Nutmeg and Cloves here as some of the aromatics we want in our food are soluble in fats but not so much in water. By toasting them in the butter here, we get kill two birds with one stone - more nutty flavour development (from the browning) and better extraction of the existing flavour (by dissolving in fat before emulsifying).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Add two egg yolks to a medium sized bowl. Add milk, brown sugar, vanilla to bowl. Whisk to combine.
<ol>
<li>[why] Adding the eggs first makes it easier to remove bits of shell that might sneak their way in there. But <em>pshh</em> that <em>never</em> happens… better safe than sorry though!</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Add flour gradually and mix just until clumps are smaller than marbles. No need to add salt - the blood  already has enough in it.</li>
<li>Add butter and blood to bowl and mix <em>just</em> until flour is wet - small clumps are okay!</li>
<li>Cover batter and rest in fridge for 30m. (if you’re strapped for time, 15 minutes is good enough)
<ol>
<li>[why] Letting your batter rest in the fridge allows the flour to hydrate and the gluten to develop. For most crepes, you’d let it rest longer <em>but</em> it’s alright (maybe preferable?) if this one is a bit tooth-y so we can cut it short.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Heat the same skillet you browned the butter in over medium-high heat. Ladle about 1/4-1/3 cup batter into skillet and swirl (with your wrist!) to thinly and evenly coat the bottom of the pan. Cook until completely and evenly brown on one side and then flip (see gif above!). Cook for another 1-2m then transfer to a plate. Optionally, cover with foil to keep warm while cook the rest.</li>
</ol>
<p>Serve crepes with nutella/chocolaty filling and lemon curd<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>. Alternatively, nutella and bananas work well too - experiment to find out what you like!</p>
<p><strong>Do Ahead:</strong> Batter can be made 1 day ahead, but leave out the blood. Keep chilled until ready to cook. Stir in blood and let sit 5 minutes before cooking.</p>
<h5 id="recipe-notes">Recipe Notes</h5>
<ul>
<li>Unlike the cookies (or other reports about pancakes) these crepes were very resilient to burning - I accidentally left one for 15 minutes and it was crispier than the others but not burnt!</li>
<li>The Bon Appetit recipie uses a blender - I’ve opted to simply mix in a bowl for a denser crepe to compliment the richness brought by the blood. Also, who wants to clean a blender? Additionally, not everyone owns a blender, but most people have a bowl.</li>

<p>Put simply, it’s a <em>big</em> problem. If you’re female (or estrogen haver), there’s a large chance<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup> you’ve either been anemic or <em>will</em> be anemic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I was woken up when my body hit the floor. My first thought was ‘Sophia, why did you lie down on the bathroom floor? You’re in your pajamas.’” - My anemic friend, Sophia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, the solution is seemingly simple. The World Health Organization (WHO) breaks their strategy to reduce world wide anemia rates into a three part plan<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7:3">[7:3]</a></sup>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increase iron intake</li>
<li>Control infection<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup></li>
<li>Improve nutritional status</li>
</ol>
<p>To accomplish these goals, the WHO has developed a  “comprehensive package of public health measures.” However, while we wait for large scale change, billions of people have an immediate need to improve their situation.</p>
<p>Adding blood to your diet accomplishes the first and most important components of the WHOs plan to beat anemia. If you don’t have access to fortified cereals or supplements<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup>, the simple addition of blood to a meal can make sure you intake enough iron.</p>
<p>But where does one get blood to cook with in the first place?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of all [slaughter house] waste products, the waste in the form of blood has the highest polluting value. Blood itself has a high BOD: 150,000 - 200,000 mg/l, the extreme value being 405,000 mg/l. (Domestic wastewater has a BOD of 300 mg/l). In the killing, bleeding and skinning phases, <strong>blood is produced which, when completely sewered, leads to a total waste load of 10 kg BOD per ton of LWK. A waste load of up to 3.0 kg BOD per ton of LWK may occur in wastewater flowing out of the killing-area and the hide-removal-area.</strong> (<a href="www.fao.org/3/x6114e/x6114e04.htm#b12-2.3.2.1.%20Wastewater%20by%20red%20meat%20slaughtering">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many slaughter houses have so much excess blood that, even after selling what they can for fertilizer/pig feed/other uses, they still dump tonnes down the drain. Butchers do much of the same<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup>, but seem more willing to sell blood to customers if they ask<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup>. In my case, I simply had to ask and I got blood for free in a win-win situation: I got blood and they got the blood off their hands. (see <a href="#sourcing-blood">Sourcing Blood</a> for details).</p>
<p>In this light, adding blood into your cooking repertoire is a classic ecofeminist move<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup>, - it empowers women to improve their own health through accessible and ecofriendly action. And on top of that, if you’re able to get your blood for free, you’re not supporting the killing of the animal, only making sure that everything produced gets used.</p>
<p>Blood consumption where an animal wasn’t killed toes the ethical boundaries developed by Ethical Vegetarianism/Veganism. As long as you’re not contributing to the killing animals and simply diverting blood from a environmentally taxing disposal pathway, you’re in the green.</p>
<p>Blood consumption may also help address some commonly cited problems with vegetarianism/veganism, namely inaccessibility (eg. the high price of plant based diets in some parts of the world). Veganism in the United States<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup> is often considered a thing of privilege, especially along lines of socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity and education. Further compounding issues of privilege, anemia rates are <em>heavily</em> correlated with socioeconomic status, at least in children (even when you control for red meat consumption, BMI, Age etc.):</p>

<p>Rate of Child Anemia vs Socioeconomic Status in Tennessee, Rural China, Korea and various Low and Middle Income Countries (<a href="./blood/data/Anemia-Rate-Figure-Generation.html">how I made this figure</a>)</p>
<p>Similar trends (as one might predict) can be seen across educational and racial gradients (not shown here).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your health and my health are reflexive of one another, and their health hangs in this balance. (PMS Vol1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Until a vegetarian/vegan diet is <em>attainable</em> and doesn’t put you at <em>risk</em> of anemia I proffer vegetarianism+ and veganism+ where the plus represents blood consumption as practical and more ecofriendly alternative.</p>
<p>I don’t expect everyone will call multiple farms and ask for blood (see my notes on sourcing below) - that would be like suggesting yoga to a depressed person<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup>. However, if you’ve got a local butcher: ask them if they can save you some blood! Make a dish! Fight back by fighting anemia, channel your inner vampire. Killing animals is probably unethical. Eating blood doesn’t have to be.</p>

<p>Jamie Vulva made cookies with her menstrual blood. They were “too floury” for her taste, thus she never made them again. However, the picture she posted on her tumblr, for lack of a better descriptor, blew up on the Internet featured most commonly in a manner making fun of “fanatic feminists”.</p>
<figure><img src="./blood/pics/menstrual-blood-cookies-original.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Menstrual blood cookies</figcaption></figure>
<p>In all fairness, Jamie Vulvas tumblr is pretty provocative. Suffice it to say the title of her blog is “Little girl, big pig” and she self describes as a “walking trigger warning”. However the discrepancy in the reaction the internet to her menstrual blood jar (a jar in which she puts her vaginal discharge) verses that to her cooking with mentrual blood seems is interesting. Why is it that cooking blood is that much worse than, say, painting with it? Is it the act of consumption? Does the problem lie in that is menstrual blood, and that cooking with “normal” blood is perfectly permissible? Even though the original “I made menstrual blood cookies!” post was made in 2011, I have yet to find another act or artifact that elucidates a similar instantaneous and visceral rejection from the online public.</p>
<p>Jamie Vulva now runs a vegan restaurant in Olympia, Washington and I’ve reached out to her because I’m curious both about her cooking with menstrual blood and how she handled the unwanted Internet attention. She’s yet to respond.</p>

<p>It’s often hard to know when things are done, as the blood turns a deep brown when heated. This means that perfectly-done cookies and overdone cookies look <em>very</em> similar:</p>
<p>![Underdone and Overdone Cookies](They look almost the same, but taste very different.)</p>
<p>On the right the cookies are underdone, but on the left they’re overdone, edging on burnt. The easy way to fix this is trust your timer - when it beeps, take them out!</p>

<h3 id="removing-clots">Removing Clots</h3>
<p>Some sources<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup> recommend blending your blood after it’s defrosted to, at least I assume, prevent any clots from making their way into the final product. I find that straining the blood is much more convenient, and allows me to strain directly into a weighing dish as not to waste blood in the blender. It also has the upside of not needing to clean a blender.</p>

<p>Instead of freezing large batches, I recommend freezing in ice cube trays - measuring out so each blood cube (aka a <em>blube</em>) is 43g (one egg white equivalent). Three cubes (129g) are two egg equivalents which makes for easy portioning.</p>

<h3 id="microwaving">Microwaving</h3>
<p>I, being someone who often cooks on a whim instead of a plan, often want to speed up the defrosting process. All my attempts to microwave defrost blood have resulted in at least some charring. (And believe me when I say you <em>don’t</em> want to know what burnt blood a la microwave smells like.) Ultimately, I’ve found a warm bowl of water to most effective.</p>

<p>My process of obtaining the original 7 liters of pigs blood was, at the very least, not streamlined. I called 15+ increasingly distant places that sold specialty meat or did their own butchering. I eventually found a very kind farmer that was willing to help - in the end he asked a client he was butchering for if it was okay if he saved the blood for me. (I’ve left his name out for privacy/legal reasons.) However, other people seem to have had better luck than me in finding someone willing to sell them blood, so your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="TODO">this thread</a> prepared carbon monoxide<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">[21]</a></sup> and bubbled the gas through some blood.</p>
<figure><img src="./blood/pics/IMG_20200308_231308.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Carbon monoxide treatment setup</figcaption></figure>
<p>From left to right I have: the reaction producing carbon monoxide, a cold trap and finnaly the blood. In the bottom right hand corner, there is a small scintilation vial with blood in it that I purged with {N2|chem} and then flowed carbon monoxide through. The glassware available to me at this point was minimal due to SARS-CoV-2 induce lab closures and so I was using the cold trap instead of a more suitable substitute. The cold trap was nessesary as the carbon monoxide produced was hot enough to cook the blood on contact. When stopping this reaction I was quite tired (it was well past midnight) and I removed the reaction flask from the heat without venting the system to atmosphere. This caused a vacuum and ended up pulling water from the cold trap (which was there to dissolve any excess sulphuric/formic acid vapour given off by the reaction) up and into the reaction flask. The water quickly boiled and blew the stopper off of the flask thus releasing enough carbon monoxide into the fume hood that I was worried for my safety.</p>
<figure><img src="./blood/pics/2020-03-09_messenger.png" alt=""><figcaption>Messenger texts about me possibly being poisoned</figcaption></figure>
<p>My symptoms for the next 24 hours lead me to belive that I was only in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide_poisoning#Acute_poisoning">200-400ppm zone</a>. I am thankful that I was not working alone, and my lab partner helped me clean up and put things away. I walked home and had difficulties deciding whether or not to take my nightly medications (which should have been a no brainer: don’t, they lower blood pressure). The next morning I woke up hazy and gave a very hazy presentation about pink capitalism in the gender neutral clothing industry and continued on with life without further complications.</p>
<p>Take away: don’t work very late at night, and if you do make sure you have the right setup with extra stages to prevent backflow accidents.</p>
<p>Sadly, due to SARS-CoV-2, this lab space was shut down the next day and I was unable to retrieve my samples. All that for naught as the carbon monoxide treated samples were not distinguishable by eye.</p>
