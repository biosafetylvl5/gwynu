<h4 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>3 Tbs Unsalted Butter</li>
<li>2 Large Egg Yolks</li>
<li>1 1/6 Cup Milk (Whole is best)</li>
<li>1/3 cup Dark Brown Sugar</li>
<li>1 Tbs Vanilla</li>
<li>1 cup Flour</li>
<li>86g Pigs Blood, frozen is fine (Salted)</li>
<li>1/2 Tsp. Cinnamon</li>
<li>1 Tsp. Nutmeg</li>
<li>1/2 Tsp. Ground Cloves</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="recipe-preparation">Recipe Preparation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Melt butter in crepe skillet over medium heat. Routinely stir to get browned bits off the bottom of the pan. When butter is light amber colored, add Cinnamon, Nutmeg and Ground Cloves. Stir to combine and remove from heat
<ol>
<li>[why] Brown butter (aka <em>buerre noisette</em>) is made by heating butter to 120C. Since the water has already boiled off (we’re above 100C), the milk solids in butter brown (al a maillard reaction)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>. What’s left after is an amber liquid with suspended dark solids that has a nutty aroma and taste. We add our Cinnamon, Nutmeg and Cloves here as some of the aromatics we want in our food are soluble in fats but not so much in water. By toasting them in the butter here, we get kill two birds with one stone - more nutty flavour development (from the browning) and better extraction of the existing flavour (by dissolving in fat before emulsifying).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Add two egg yolks to a medium sized bowl. Add milk, brown sugar, vanilla to bowl. Whisk to combine.
<ol>
<li>[why] Adding the eggs first makes it easier to remove bits of shell that might sneak their way in there. But <em>pshh</em> that <em>never</em> happens… better safe than sorry though!</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Add flour gradually and mix just until clumps are smaller than marbles. No need to add salt - the blood  already has enough in it.</li>
<li>Add butter and blood to bowl and mix <em>just</em> until flour is wet - small clumps are okay!</li>
<li>Cover batter and rest in fridge for 30m. (if you’re strapped for time, 15 minutes is good enough)
<ol>
<li>[why] Letting your batter rest in the fridge allows the flour to hydrate and the gluten to develop. For most crepes, you’d let it rest longer <em>but</em> it’s alright (maybe preferable?) if this one is a bit tooth-y so we can cut it short.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Heat the same skillet you browned the butter in over medium-high heat. Ladle about 1/4-1/3 cup batter into skillet and swirl (with your wrist!) to thinly and evenly coat the bottom of the pan. Cook until completely and evenly brown on one side and then flip (see gif above!). Cook for another 1-2m then transfer to a plate. Optionally, cover with foil to keep warm while cook the rest.</li>
</ol>
<p>Serve crepes with nutella/chocolaty filling and lemon curd<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>. Alternatively, nutella and bananas work well too - experiment to find out what you like!</p>
<p><strong>Do Ahead:</strong> Batter can be made 1 day ahead, but leave out the blood. Keep chilled until ready to cook. Stir in blood and let sit 5 minutes before cooking.</p>
<h5 id="recipe-notes">Recipe Notes</h5>
<ul>
<li>Unlike the cookies (or other reports about pancakes) these crepes were very resilient to burning - I accidentally left one for 15 minutes and it was crispier than the others but not burnt!</li>
<li>The Bon Appetit recipie uses a blender - I’ve opted to simply mix in a bowl for a denser crepe to compliment the richness brought by the blood. Also, who wants to clean a blender? Additionally, not everyone owns a blender, but most people have a bowl.</li>
