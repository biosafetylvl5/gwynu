# Activists Cry with One Eye

In this essay, I compare Tear Gun by YiFei and The White Meadows^[@rasoulof2009] by Rasolouf Mohammad and their use of tears to investigate individual responsibility in the face of oppression. I also tie in writings of P.M.S. (Power Makes us Sick, a feminist group focusing on autonomous healthcare practices and networks)

Tear Gun and The White Meadows are about as different as you can get - one is a handmade and tangible object and the other is a behemoth Iranian Film. Despite their difference, they both explore tears in and in response to power. By examining them side-by-side we extract more meaning from them than if one could simply taking them in isolation. At the end, I'll offer some thoughts on effective activism.

To get the most out of this essay, I'd recommend watching [YiFei's one-minute video](https://www.chenyifeidesign.com/fei/tear-gun) about her project and the [trailer for The White Meadows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha3fs7Zs6yU). Hell, watching all of TWM would be best but if you don't mind serious spoilers, I'll do my best to catch you up as we go ^[hopefully, you'll want to watch TWM after you've finished reading this]. 

Let's start with The White Meadows.

The White Meadows is a 2009 film made by the Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof. Featuring a cacophony of symbolism, the allegory was a bit too strong with this one, earning Mohammed six years in prison and a 20 year ban from leaving the country, giving interviews or making movies[factcheck needed]. Even though the white Meadows has never been shown in Iran, its incessant exploration of state exploration is a characteristic it shares with other classic Iranian films. According to Prof. Beyazie of Stanford University being banned is often seen among Iranian directors as a badge of honor - not unlike in early career studies, if you're not pushing boundaries what's the point of doing anything at all? Fear not, the white Meadows does plenty of pushing, hardly stopping to breathe in between islands of salt barons interrogating misogyny/objectification of women, superstition, social order, etc. etc. the list goes on. And among all we follow the main character as he travels from misfortune to misfortune collecting people's tears in a special glass bottle. We along with the people he visits never know why he's collecting tears but it's clear he's not new always expected, never explained.

At the end, the main character uses the tears of countless people to wash a patriarchal power figures feet, ultimately disposing of them into the ocean. This scene is a clear and poignant commentary on classest authoritarian rule; *"the poor can cry so that the rich can have clean feet"* if you will.

In The White Meadows, the main character travels from salt rock to salt rock on a tight schedule. With each stop, we explore a new aspect of how authoritarian rule seeps into everyday life. Some examples are flighty and require work on the audience's part, but others are extremely heavy-handed (think "pouring monkey urine in an artist's eye because he painted the sea as read into the blue" level of heavy-handed). In total, he main character visits six islands - five collecting tears and one delivering them.

On the second island, the main character and a stowaway are present for a jinn banishing ceremony. For the past 300 years "the ocean has just been getting more and more salty," ^[quote check needed] and the locals blame it on a jinn that fled to the bottom of the well. When the main character arrives, the locals are expecting him. And while he does end up collecting some tears, he breaks his otherwise monotone modus operandi to collect prayers and secrets in glass jars. This suggests that he's more than a tier collector, and occupies a role similar to a spiritual tax collector/administrator. He also is called to take someone to a prison rock later, further strengthening his role in maintaining authoritarian control beyond simple tear collection.

The dynamics of the jinn banishing ritual are interesting (read: more authoritarian commentary)^[footnote about disability theory implications in this scene] , but The White Meadows is one hour and 38 minutes of symbolically rich allegory that never stops - every scene feels atemporally iconic and unforgettable - and then they're gone.

In this way, Tear Gun is very different: it's not a scene or an image nor a dialogue. It's a physical object made of brass and plastic. You could touch it if YiFei was feeling generous ^[footnote about The Art Assignment's influence here]. But, Tear Gun's and The White Meadows are separated by more than just physicality - their interrogation of in crying and power may be their only direct similarity.

The Tear Gun was made by YiFei during her Master Study of Arts in Amsterdam[fc]. Coming from Taiwan, she had been taught not to question authority. Which, in a climate clash with Amsterdam Universities' questioning culture, resulted in her crying in front of a school administrator due to a tutor's[fc] unreasonable expectations. "In that moment, all I could do was cry"^[made up quote, find real one] but after, YiFei found a way to turn her sadness into power. She did so directly, in the form of Tear Gun which is a *gun* that collects *tears*, and as the word gun implies, shoots them as projectiles.

This direct transformation of sadness (tears) into power (firepower) serves as a foil for The White Meadows which is often unyieldingly abstract layered symbolism. Further, in The White Meadows, sadness (tears) serve only to further repress the powerless and reinforce the position of the powerful. But in this case, said reinforcement is only symbolic (maybe performatic? Performative?). After all, having your feet washed pales in comparison to an actual gun when in a physical fight.

But direct versus abstract methods of obtaining power of the only ways that Tear Gun in the white Meadows contrast. The Tear Gun is individualistically empowering (it is a gun powered by your own tears, literally self empowerment). The white Meadows is all about mass disenfranchisement, how tears and pain are used in cycles of authoritarian maneuvering.
Unfortunately, these differences aren't limited to the art itself. For the amazing sheet that is The White Meadows, Mohammed has been banned from film making giving and from interviews for 20 years on top of a six year prison sentence. For YiFei, things were different - she got to fire her gun at the school administrator when she got a Masters Degree for her work.

When we cry, we often feel alone. But for better or worse, crying is a performative act, cyclically citing societal constructs to produce meaning. We are never alone, even in our own sobs, we produce Foucauldian biopower intertwining our oppression, and per contra our liberation, to tears.

On a deeper level both the white Meadows and Tear Gun dig into questions of humanity, of purpose. I've struggled to put you face motivation into words, why does turning your tears into bullets makes sense, what purpose does it serve? Is it defensive? Offenses? Reflexive? Proactive? And to be honest I don't have a good answer for you - if you asked YiFei I bet her answer would be self contradicting and amorphous. Thing is, while I struggle for words I am clear in understanding. YiFei's Tear Gun makes intuitive sense to me. Is it is not human to want out of the situation where one feels weak? What Tear Gun really does is ask and offer an answer to one of societies most basic questions: what can one do from weakness? For you YiFei the answer is clear: in weakness, you fight even if tears are all you have.

But for the main character of The White Meadows, the question remains unanswered. Even with the ammunition of collected tears he trends lightly never stepping so far into purposeful action that he can't dart back to the security of inaction. The primary and most devastating example of this is encapsulated in the main character's relationship with a stowaway found on his boat.

This stowaway (who was never honored with a name) is a young boy who serves on the main character's boat after the main character visits his island in hopes of finding his missing father. Even when we first meet him, the stowaway is a direct foil to the main character with his uniquely purposeful action met with defense of the status quo by the main character. The main character initially throws the stowaway (aka an opportunity for change, action) off of the boat to drown, only allowing him to stay (living that is) in threat of blackmail. ^[the stowaway's blackmail is yet another example of his abundant purposeful action:  the details of the blackmail point out that he had thought through his plan and had waited for the opportune time] However, the stowaway is only allowed to stay upon the condition that he pretend to be deaf and mute and never intervenes in the main characters work thus minimizing his impact on the main characters status quo.

The stowaway remains faithful to his agreement with the main character until he attempts to save the life of a young woman sent to die at sea as part of a local ritual. In reaction to his attempted breach of the expected outcome (the murder of a young girl), the locals sentence the stowaway to death by stoning as punishment. The main character instructs the stowaway to wait a moment after the hail of rocks begins and then cry for help. The boy has dutifully remained silent as per the main characters request so when the locals hear the stowaway's screams of pain during the stoning, it is easy for the main character to convince them "that God has forgiven him"^[quote made up, need real one] and thus they should too.

> When white^[sub in able-bodied/straight/cis] people educate themselves and begin to get an understanding of just how bad things still are, it can feel like a crushing weight. They might feel guilty, sad, overwhelmed. What are you supposed to do with this information? It seems unfixable and like there’s nothing you can do ([Five Stages of Unlearning Racism](https://kronda.com/five-stages-of-unlearning-racism/))

This - the saving of the stowaway - is one of two isolated acts of the main characters to interfere with current proceedings. Both attempts occur in climactic times of need, both attempts aim to save someone. These acts indicate that, unlike most people in The White Meadows, the main characters sees that the proceedings around him are wrong. And while he fails to act often, his small efforts to save a few do much. This moral ambiguity contributes heavily by polluting his character with morality, raising him from the depths of purely despicable Bad Guy(TM). 

However, his actions aren't enough. 

They aren't enough for the artist he tries to save - he rotted away in prison. They weren't enough for the stowaway - he eventually died from the stoning. Just as the stowaway died *oh so close* to finding his father (his father lived on the very next island that the main character visited), the main character is *oh so close* to powerful and purposeful action that  *actually* enacts change. If only the main character had a Tear Gun of his own, maybe he'd start enacting some changes - he surely has more than enough ammunition as the state tear collector. Although, in true main character fashion he's likely to simply drop any Tear-Gun-like object into the ocean: never to be seen again.

In the end, that's the point The White Meadows is trying to get across: if people like the main character don't take a stand, Iran will remain as it is. Patriarchal, authoritarian, oppressive. Weakness, in all of its forms is a fuel, and it's up to us all to figure out how to burn it effectively. If we intervene too late, our stowaway will still die. Purposeful action early and often will lead to change if you let it.

This is where Tear Gun stalls - how do we turn our collective pain into collective action (or occasionally, individual pain into individual action)? Do we go on the offensive turning our tears into weapons (a la Tear Gun)? Or should we use our tears defensively a la [Bioshield](https://www.bioshield.me/) - harnesing chemosignals to preemptively diffuse testosterone fueled^[footnote: about how testosterone *isnt* the problem] violence?

However, "slacktivism" is not the answer. Changing your profile pic on Facebook/Twitter/Tumblr etc. to support a cause is... fine^[footnote about ... slacktivism and the effectiveness of this] but the buck *cannot* stop online. Donating 1$ a month to [The Bail Project](bailproject.org) enacts *actual* change. Buying an extra sandwich and sharing it with someone who's homeless enacts *actual* change.
