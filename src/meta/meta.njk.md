A collection of markup documents, multimedia documents and links therin. [This particular Website](https://gwynu.com) contains content made by Gwyn Uttmark. Resources from elsewhere are explicitly marked as so.

This website is hosted ethically by [Acorn Host](https://www.acornhost.com/) with servers completely powered by green energy and is built using [Metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io).

### Software

GWYNU is a static website built with [metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io). 

I take a javascript non-essentalist approach (if you don't need it, don't use it!), so anything that can be rendered server side is. Anything client side should be as minimal as possible. The server side however is *my problem* so it can be as ~aweful~ complicated as I ~would like~ can stand.
