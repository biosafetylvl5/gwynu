Send Nudes<br/><span style="transform:scale(-1, 1);display:inline-block">💦</span>🍑🌗🍆💦</h1></center>

**Who**: We are three seniors^[We are Gwyn Uttmark, Enrique De Alba, and Michael Arcidiacono Chem, CS, and Chem - we only do Cs.]  who had an idea.^[ Also, *ahem* IF YOU ARE UNDERAGE PLS DELETE THIS PAGE FROM YOUR MEMORY. WE ARE NOT HERE TO GET ARRESTED. WE DON'T WANT ANY CHILD PORN (why do I even need to say that?????)]

**What**: Send nudes to the moon. (I guess you could send anything... we're not gonna check... 5$ is 5$😉)

**Where**: We just? told you that. The moon. Via a rocket. A [capsule](https://www.astrobotic.com/moon-box) will be left with a SD card containing all the *funky* photos. 

**When**: Pay 5$ 'n [send nudes now](linky), put your dick/pussy/ass/idk whatever you call it/dildo on moon in 2021.

**Why**: why^[Also, I just *reallllly* like the idea of putting the *first* q/t/poc nudes on the moon. MOON NUDITY IS OURS TOO. take that nasa] not lol 

(it also supports a good cause^[Supports work on quantifying estradiol in grey market drugs - aka harm reduction stuff for trans folks. Help us do trans-positive science: send nudes.], and also the [first commercial lunar landing in history](https://www.astrobotic.com/) but..... *nudes on the moon* is def the important part)
