**Ingredients**
- 1 1/2 Cups Enriched Flour
- 1.25 Tsp Baking Soda
- 1.5 Cups Packed Brown Sugar
- 1/3 Cup Full Fat Greek Yogurt
- 1/2 Stick (4 Tbs) Unsalted Butter
- 130g Blood
- 4-5 Ripe Bananas
- 1/2 Tsp. Nutmeg
- 1/4 Tsp. Ground Cloves
- 110g 88% Dark Chocolate
- 1/2 - 1 cup Walnuts (optional)
- 1/2 - 1 cup Pecans (optional)

**Recipe Preparation**
1. If blood is frozen, set out to thaw. Preheat oven to 350F, lightly grease and line a 4 1/2 x 8 1/2 loaf pan with parchment paper with overhang for removing the bread later.
1. Melt butter in skillet over medium heat. Routinely stir to get browned bits off the bottom of the pan. When butter is light amber colored, add Nutmeg and Ground Cloves. Stir to combine and remove from heat.
	1. [why] Brown butter (aka *buerre noisette*) is made by heating butter to 120C. Since the water has already boiled off (we're above 100C), the milk solids in butter brown (al a maillard reaction)^[info from [bon appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/entertaining-style/article/brown-butter)]. What's left after is an amber liquid with suspended dark solids that has a nutty aroma and taste. We add our Nutmeg and Cloves here as some of the aromatics we want in our food are soluble in fats but not so much in water. By toasting them in the butter here, we get kill two birds with one stone - more nutty flavour development (from the browning) and better extraction of the existing flavour (by dissolving in fat before emulsifying).
1. In a large/medium bowl (or a stand mixer), beat Brown Sugar, Greek Yogurt, Blood and Browned Butter until [include visual marker here], about 4 minutes. 
1. If using a stand mixer, reduce speed to low and add flour and stir until just combined (like pancake batter).
1. Roughly Chop Dark Chocolate, Walnuts and Pecans. Smash bananas if not using a stand mixer.
1. Add bananas and baking powder to bowl, mix until combined. Fold in Chocolate, Walnuts and Pecans.  
1. Scrape batter into prepared pan and bake until a tester comes out clean, roughly 60 minutes. Remove from pan and let cool 1 hour if you can resist taste-testing.

**Bonus:** Sprinkle raw sugar on the top before baking for extra *crunch*

**Do Ahead:** Batter can be made 1 day ahead and kept in the fridge, but **leave out the baking powder**. When you're ready to bake, add it and mix gently to incorporate.
