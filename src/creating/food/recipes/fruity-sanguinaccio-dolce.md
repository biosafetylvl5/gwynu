#### Ingredients
- 200mL Milk
- 145g Brown Sugar
- 170g 88% Dark Chocolate
- 100g Red Wine (Anything dark and fruity will do, I used an Edna Valley Vineyard Pinot Noir from 2017)
- 250g Blood

#### Recipe Preparation

1. Add milk, wine, brown sugar, and chocolate to double boiler (or [a bowl over a pot with simmering water](https://www.bonappetit.com/video/watch/how-to-melt-chocolate-in-a-double-boiler)).
2. Mix occassionally as to not let the chocolate burn until the chocolate is mostly melted
3. Add blood and whisk slowly until mixture is thick and gooey with a consistency similar to a cooled pudding or hot custard.
4. Take off heat and serve warm (traditional) or cold (my preference) with ladyfingers or other dipping biscuit 

Makes 10-12 servings, lasts 1-2 weeks in the fridge.
