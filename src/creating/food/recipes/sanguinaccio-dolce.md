#### Ingredients
- 250mL Milk
- 38g White Sugar
- 100g Brown Sugar
- 1-2 Tsp. Cinnamon (Optional)
- 170g 88% Dark Chocolate
- 250g Blood (Or maybe 127g? Notes unclear, need to re-test.)

#### Recipe Preparation

![Chocolate and milk in double boiler](./blood/pics/db-choco.jpg)

1. Add milk, white and brown sugar, cinnamon and chocolate to double boiler (or [a bowl over a pot with simmering water](https://www.bonappetit.com/video/watch/how-to-melt-chocolate-in-a-double-boiler)).
2. Mix lightly as to not let the chocolate burn until the chocolate is mostly melted
3. Add blood and whisk slowly until mixture is thick and gooey with a consistency similar to a cooled pudding or hot custard.
4. Take off heat and serve warm (traditional) or cold (my preference) with ladyfingers or other dipping biscuit 

Makes 10-12 servings, lasts 1-2 weeks in the fridge.

##### Recipe Notes

- Still working on this recipe. From tastings, it pairs well with hazelnut, caramel and coffee. Might work well as an eclair filling? Might go well with a rose-vanilla ice cream/gelato? Will try with all brown sugar next time.
