# Baking with Blood

In what started out as an attempt to replicate the [Sanguinaccio Dolce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgJY0jPspMw) depicted in the TV series [Hannibal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_(TV_series)), I've learned a lot about cooking with blood and I've done my best to document that so that others might have an easier time. New to me (and to most americans I've talked to) blood has been used in cooking forever. I write about anemia and iron consumption and how consuming blood-based baked goods might be a better idea that it may initally seem. In a moment of existential crisis, I thought about the ethics/justification for consuming blood which I also include here. I have also assembled a small collection of historical / traditional recipies that use blood along with a list of all the contemporary recipies I've stumbled upon. Finaly, I include some notes on sourcing, storage and a botched carbon monoxide treatment.

/u/FloppyKitties asked:

How does diet affect the flavor, from your experience? Do you have a preference for certain people's blood over others? Sorry, I'm so fascinated.

Just generally healthy and well hydrated is great. Fruit makes the blood sweet. Poor diet might make the blood overly salty, and if they've eaten recently, it might be a bit fattier. I've only ever tasted one guy who has really weird and bad tasting blood, but he smokes a lot and his diet isn't overly unhealthy, just very strange. Like, he'd eat a whole head of broccoli dunked in sour cream. TMI warning: His cum tasted absolutely awful too, extremely bitter. I think he's just a weird outlier.

Honestly, the method of storage matters more to the flavour than who it's from and what they eat. Even bad blood is still pretty good. Aside from that one guy.

## Sanguinaccio dolce

> "Sanguinaccio dolce. A classic Neapolitan dessert, with almond milk. Easy on the stomach. 
> Blood and chocolate. That should've been the subtitle of my book." - Hannibal, The Great Red Dragon [S03E08]

Sanguinnacio dolce is a simple dish, with only four key ingridients: milk, sugar, chocolate and blood. Unsurprisingly, blood is the hardest to aquire now-a-days. It needing to be cooked or frozen quickly after slaughter means that sanguinnacio dolce, a once popular Southern Italian signature dish is now restricted to those with easy access to livestock.

After calling a number of famers, I [managed to aquire](#sourcing) roughly half of a gallon of fresh pigs blood. Starting with a recipie from [Emiko Davies](http://www.emikodavies.com/blog/blood-chocolate-sanguinaccio/), I gave sanguinnacio dolce my first shot. 

It was, I must say, not good. The final result was slightly grainy and had a very iron heavy flavour profile. Working with the blood brought up feelings similar to the first time I cooked with meat, definitly a high "eww" factor.

Working with the blood more eliminated the quisiness and adjusting the ingridient ratios fixed the flavour profile. The texture was fixed by changing the order of ingridiant addition (milk & chocolate first until melted, *then* add the blood). All in all, I had a wonderful dessert, a lot of blood and a ever increasing interest in incorporating blood into food.

In the TV show, Hannibal uses almond milk, whole cloves, bovine blood and what appears to be dark chocolate. He serves it in an orange peel with lady fingers, blue berries, blackberries, raspberries and a whole cinnamon stick.

## Ethics of Blood Consumption

>Iron deficiency affects more people than any other condition, constituting a public health condition of epidemic proportions. More subtle in its manifestations than, for example, protein-energy malnutrition, iron deficiency exacts its heaviest overall toll in terms of ill-health, premature death and lost earnings.[^who-iron]

Iron deficiency anemia is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world[^who-iron] and the heme-iron (which is found in meats, organs and blood) is the most bio-available natural iron source available. Iron deficiency anemia rates are not equal across demographics - women are by far the most affected, but infants and children are also heavily affected. Today, more than 1.6 billion people suffer from anemia^[https://www.who.int/vmnis/anaemia/prevalence/summary/anaemia_data_status_t2/en/]. Even in a "first-world" country like the USA, iron deficiency anemia isn't uncommon^[https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-HealthProfessional/]. Globally, almost 47% of preschool-age children have anemia, and anemia contributes to 20% of all maternal deaths[^who-iron]. 

Put simply, it's a *big* problem. If you're female (or estrogen haver), there's a large chance you've either been anemic or *will* be anemic.

> "I was woken up when my body hit the floor. My first thought was 'Sophia, why did you lie down on the bathroom floor? You're in your pajamas.'" - On fainting due to anemia, my friend Sophia

Luckily, the solution is seemingly simple: eat more iron.

To accomplish these goals, the WHO has developed a  "comprehensive package of public health measures."[^who-iron-plan] However, while we wait for large scale change, billions of people have an immediate need to improve their situation.

Adding blood to your diet accomplishes the first and most important components of the WHOs plan to beat anemia. If you don't have access to fortified cereals or supplements^[I don't want to encourage anyone to not seek out these arguably better methods of intaking iron. That said, if you need iron supplementation and aren't getting it through fortified foods or supplements because of availability or associated gastrointestional issues, blood represents an alternative method of increasing iron intake. Find what works for you, but find it.], the simple addition of blood to a meal can make sure you intake enough iron. 

But where does one get blood to cook with in the first place?

> Of all [slaughter house] waste products, the waste in the form of blood has the highest polluting value. Blood itself has a high BOD^[BOD level is a common metric for water pollution.[http://butane.chem.uiuc.edu/pshapley/Environmental/L31/1.html](http://butane.chem.uiuc.edu/pshapley/Environmental/L31/1.html)]: 150,000 - 200,000 mg/l, the extreme value being 405,000 mg/l. (Domestic wastewater has a BOD of 300 mg/l). In the killing, bleeding and skinning phases, **blood is produced which, when completely sewered, leads to a total waste load of 10 kg BOD per ton of LWK^[Live Weight Killed, a common meat processing measurement]. A waste load of up to 3.0 kg BOD per ton of LWK may occur in wastewater flowing out of the killing-area and the hide-removal-area.** ([source](www.fao.org/3/x6114e/x6114e04.htm#b12-2.3.2.1.%20Wastewater%20by%20red%20meat%20slaughtering))

Many slaughter houses have so much excess blood that, even after selling what they can for fertilizer/pig feed/other uses, they still dump tonnes down the drain. Butchers do much of the same^[source?], but seem more willing to sell blood to customers if they ask^[source?]. In my case, I simply had to ask and I got blood for free in a win-win situation: I got blood and they got the blood off their hands. (see [Sourcing Blood](#sourcing-blood) for details).

All these factors, adding blood into your cooking repertoire is a classic ecofeminist move^[If, say, we started to consume *so* much blood that animals were being killed just to produce it *then* that would be a problem. I don't think we're going to get there any time soon], - it empowers women to improve their own health through accessible and ecofriendly action. And on top of that, if you're able to get your blood for free, you're not supporting the killing of the animal, only making sure that everything produced gets used.

Blood consumption where an animal wasn't killed toes the ethical boundaries developed by Ethical Vegetarianism/Veganism. As long as you're not contributing to the killing animals and simply diverting blood from a environmentally taxing disposal pathway, you're in the green.

>"There's some people commenting on the fact that I'm vegan and that I made cookies. This is really simple to understand because consensually I'm consensually giving my blood to somebody who is consensually eating my blood (or rather, would have conceptually eaten my blood). And that's no different than kissing somebody or breastfeeding or oral sex. Anything, anything like that. It's all on the same. You're just consensually ingesting another person's fluids. It's not like the norm, but I don't think it's all that strange" - Jamie Vulva

Blood consumption may also help address some worries with vegetarianism/veganism, namely inaccessibility of nutritionally complete diets. Veganism in the United States^[This is not the case in France (at least according to the numbers) nor in places where vegetarianism is considered the norm.] may be a practice of privilege, especially along lines of socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity and education. Further compounding issues of privilege, anemia rates are *heavily* correlated with socioeconomic status, at least in children (even when you control for red meat consumption, BMI, Age etc.):

![Rate of Child Anemia vs Socioeconomic Status in Tennessee, Rural China, Korea and various Low and Middle Income Countries ([how I made this figure](./blood/data/Anemia-Rate-Figure-Generation.html))](./blood/data/anemiaRates.png)

Similar positive correlations of privledge and low rates of anemia can be seen across educational and racial gradients^[??SOURCE??].

> Your health and my health are reflexive of one another, and their health hangs in this balance. (PMS Vol1) [Great quote. Does it fit right here?]

Until a nutritionally complete vegetarian/vegan diet is attainable for everyone maybe a "vegitarianism+" (where the plus represents blood consumption) is an alternative worth considering. I admit, it's a bit odd but it's a practical and more ecofriendly alternative to conventional diets that don't work for everyone. If you've got a local butcher: ask them if they can save you some blood! Make a dish! Killing animals is probably unethical. Eating blood doesn't have to be.

Jamie Vulva made cookies with her menstrual blood. They were "too floury" for her taste, thus she never made them again. However, the picture she posted on her tumblr, for lack of a better descriptor, blew up on the Internet. Often it can be found in a post trying to "prove" feminists crazy.

![Menstrual blood cookies](./blood/pics/menstrual-blood-cookies-original.jpg)

The discrepancy in the reaction of the internet to her menstrual blood jar (a jar in which she puts her vaginal discharge) verses that to her cooking with mentrual blood is interesting. Why is it that cooking blood is that much worse than, say, painting with it? Is it the act of consumption? Does the problem lie in that is menstrual blood, and that cooking with "normal" blood is perfectly permissible? Even though the original ["I made menstrual blood cookies!" post](https://web.archive.org/web/20161111030721/http://cuntbarf.tumblr.com/post/14483892353/i-made-menstrual-blood-cookies-i-am-not-entirely) was made in 2011 and I've yet to find anything similar.

Jamie Vulva now runs a [vegan restaurant](https://www.thewaysidecafe.com/) in Olympia, Washington! I'm curious both about her cooking with menstrual blood and how she handled the unwanted Internet attention. I've [reached out to her](https://www.instagram.com/jamievulva/) because I'm curious both about her cooking with menstrual blood and how she handled the unwanted Internet attention. She's yet to respond.

I've also found this picture (below) of menstrual pancakes that _may_ or _may not_ be Jamie Vulva's doing.

#### Menstrual Fluid Cookies

Transcription from a [video](https://vimeo.com/57814603) posted in 2013 by Jamie Vulva 

(edited for succintness and clarity, original can be found [here](./blood/Transcript-[Menstrual_blood_cookies!-An_explanation!]-Jamie_Vulva.txt))

(00:00): My name is Jamie Vuvla and I'm the person who made the menstrual blood cookies. I made these cookies last December and there have been people chipping on the internet about them ever since. This is the [second time they've been posted on reddit](https://web.archive.org/web/20140805051233/http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/y2roz/girl_collects_menstrual_blood_in_jar_uses_it_to/) (the first time it got buried, and that's totally fine). I figured I'd make a vlog, just explaining everything because a lot of people are making assumptions and have some false ideas about blood and how it works. I don't want that. I will start by saying that the cookies are made with real blood. There are 5 tablespoons of blood in the cookie recipe. They're made with fresh blood from the most recent cycle in December. I made them immediately after I was finished bleeding and collecting blood and all that. There have been lot of questions about the color of the cookies.

(01:25): They're like red velvet looking almost. And that's because I added some neon pink food coloring to balance out the, the browning  that would occur with the blood. I didn't want to make a gross looking cookie. I wanted them to be like aesthetically pleasing. There have been some remarks about clotting. There were clots in that five tablespoons. I don't pass a lot of clots, but there were some in there. When I mixed the batter, they just kind of dispersed. There's also been people talking about coagulation and about how blood coaggulates immediately. Menstrual blood is a little different. Menstrual blood is actually an incorrect, I wouldn't say it's necessarily incorrect, but it's not quite the right descriptor because what we pass is not blood. There's blood in it, but it's best described as menstrual fluid.

(02:38): It's made up of uterine lining, cervical mucus and vaginal secretions as well as like water and all kinds of other stuff. There's absolutely blood in there, but it does not make up the majority of what is in menstrual fluid. It's just what makes it red. There's also this "enzyme thing" in in the uterine lining called plasmin that prevents the blood from clotting - or coagulating, sorry, excuse me, we pass clots. That's why it doesn't coagulate and get all gross on our bodies as we pass it. Which is really wonderful because that would be horrible. It works a little bit differently than most people think because when most people think of blood, they think "coagulation" which doesn't make sense. 

(03:50): Menstrual fluid or menstrual blood aren't like regular blood. I feel like I need to also communicate that my blood jar and the blood cookies are two completely separate things. I have a blood jar that I started filling in 2009. I haven't collected in over six months just because I haven't really felt like it. But that is the jar that's pictured. I would not use that in any sort of baking ingredient. I don't even open it in the house. I wear a mask when I open it. It smells terrible and it's horrible for you to breathe in those fumes. I would never try to feed that to somebody; that could very well be lethal.

(05:06): So yeah, the cookies are made with fresh blood. I want that to be clear, fresh blood, not old blood. I'm not trying to kill anybody. I started collecting my blood in order to monitor how much how much blood I was losing, because I've always been a heavy bleeder. I had my son and I started bleeding even more. And then I got a Paraguard copper IUD and one of the side effects of that is having heavier periods. Most women bleed like between two to six tablespoons. I usually lose about three quarters of a cup which is a lot. That was why I started collecting - I wouldn't have know that otherwise. I was just like: there's like blood everywhere, all the time.

(06:12): I can't keep up with this. Oh my God. What is happening? So yeah, I started collecting my blood because of that. It sits in a jar in my bathroom. Like I said, I don't really open it very often. I only really open it when I'm adding to it and that hasn't been in a while. Usually keep aseparate, smaller jar that I'll add to for a bit, because I don't like to open the main jar very often. So I'll keep one in the fridge and add to it for awhile. And then once it gets close to being full, I'll transfer the contents to the big jar.

(06:58): How do I collect the blood? I use my diva cap. It's just a little silicone cup that goes inside your vagina. Your cervix sits in the cup and it drips [makes dripping sounds] into the cup. Then you pull it out and dump it. I dump it into a jar. Otherwise it just goes into the toilet. Really cool. They're super environmentally friendly and fairly inexpensive in the grand scheme of sanitary products. I made the cookies as a gift for somebody. They never received the cookies because I didn't like how it turned out. But originally, they were made as a gift for somebody whom I knew would appreciate them.

(08:21): I didn't make them as any sort of feminist statement or anything like that. They're just an idea that I had and I'm the kind of person who's like: "Why not make these? I have the means to do it. It could be really interesting and cool." Granted, it's kind of a weird thing to do, but they're just cookies. If you really think about it, it's just my unfertilized reproductive cycle. What do you think eggs are? Exactly. That is that just out of a chicken. It wasn't anything crazy. It was just an idea that I had. So I did it. A lot of people think I like did it for attention or whatever, and I didn't. Sometimes people do weird stuff and I think that's that's okay.

(09:34): And that should be embraced not demonized. [sighs] Did I eat them? I didn't really. I had a bite of one just to see what it tasted like - that way I knew what I theoretically was going to give to this person. And that's how I knew I was unhappy with the cookies. The whole idea of eating my menstrual blood, isn't very appealing to me. I don't really like the taste of blood in the first place. And granted, I understand it would be completely different than when baked into a cookie. I just don't like the taste of it. Nor do I have any desire eat my menstrual fluid. So yeah, I had one bite of them. And then I kept them around for awhile and debated giving them to the person who ordered them because they said that they still wanted them, even though I wasn't happy with the way they turned out. But ultimately, I decided I would rather make them another batch later on.

(10:53): There's some people commenting on the fact that I'm vegan and that I made cookies. This is really simple to understand because consensually I'm consensually giving my blood to somebody who is consensually eating my blood (or rather, would have conceptually eaten my blood). And that's no different than kissing somebody or breastfeeding or oral sex. Anything, anything like that. It's all on the same. You're just consensually ingesting another person's fluids. It's not like the norm, but I don't think it's all that strange. I get that putting them in cookies is a little bit weird, but I don't think it makes me horribly disgusting or a bad person or anything like that. I think it just makes me adventurous and maybe a little bit creative. It's fine if you don't view it that way, or if you think I need Jesus or I'm horribly disgusting or whatever. You don't have to be my friend. You don't have to eat my cookies. I'm the only one who tasted them. Nobody else did.

(12:26): Anyway, this video is too long, so I'm going to stop now.

## Assorted Notes

### Handling

### Cook Time
It's often hard to know when things are done, as the blood turns a deep brown when heated. This means that perfectly-done cookies and overdone cookies look *very* similar:

![Underdone and Overdone Cookies](They look almost the same, but taste very different.)

On the right the cookies are underdone, but on the left they're overdone, edging on burnt. The easy way to fix this is trust your timer - when it beeps, take them out!

### Removing Clots

Some sources[^nordic-food-lab]^[https://receptfavoriter.se/recept/paltbroed.html]^[https://svensktkott.se/recept/hemlagad-blodpudding/] recommend blending your blood after it's defrosted to, at least I assume, prevent any clots from making their way into the final product. I find that straining the blood is much more convenient, and allows me to strain directly into a weighing dish as not to waste blood in the blender. It also has the upside of not needing to clean a blender.

![Recipie testers straining blood](./blood/pics/20200229-staining-blood.jpg)

### Portioning

Instead of freezing large batches, I recommend freezing in ice cube trays - measuring out so each blood cube (aka a *blube*) is 43g (one egg white equivalent). Three cubes (129g) are two egg equivalents which makes for easy portioning.

![blubes](./blood/pics/20200229-blubes.jpg)

### Defrosting

I, being someone who often cooks on a whim instead of a plan, often want to speed up the defrosting process. All my attempts to microwave defrost blood have resulted in at least some charring. (And believe me when I say you *don't* want to know what burnt blood a la microwave smells like.) Ultimately, I've found a warm bowl of water to most effective.

![Blood defrosting in a bowl of warm water](./blood/pics/20200223-blood-defrosting.jpg)

<!--### Anticoagulents: Salt and Vinegar-->

### Sourcing

My process of obtaining the original 7 liters of pigs blood was, at the very least, not streamlined. I called 15+ increasingly distant places that sold specialty meat or did their own butchering. I eventually found a very kind farmer that was willing to help - in the end he asked a client he was butchering for if it was okay if he saved the blood for me. (I've left his name out for privacy/legal reasons.) However, other people seem to have had better luck than me in finding someone willing to sell them blood, so your mileage may vary.

![Blood in a pail of ice positioned in the trunk of a car](./blood/pics/blood-transport.jpg)

### Carbon Monoxide: Maintaining that Boyish Pink

Inspired by [this thread](TODO) prepared carbon monoxide^[via the dehydration of formic acid with concentrated sulfuric acid, a similar setup can be seen [in this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1ujbhBDpKs)] and bubbled the gas through some blood. 

![Carbon monoxide treatment setup](./blood/pics/IMG_20200308_231308.jpg)

From left to right I have: the reaction producing carbon monoxide, a cold trap and finnaly the blood. In the bottom right hand corner, there is a small scintilation vial with blood in it that I purged with {N2|chem} and then flowed carbon monoxide through. The glassware available to me at this point was minimal due to SARS-CoV-2 induce lab closures and so I was using the cold trap instead of a more suitable substitute. The cold trap was nessesary as the carbon monoxide produced was hot enough to cook the blood on contact. When stopping this reaction I was quite tired (it was well past midnight) and I removed the reaction flask from the heat without venting the system to atmosphere. This caused a vacuum and ended up pulling water from the cold trap (which was there to dissolve any excess sulphuric/formic acid vapour given off by the reaction) up and into the reaction flask. The water quickly boiled and blew the stopper off of the flask thus releasing enough carbon monoxide into the fume hood that I was worried for my safety. 

![Messenger texts about me possibly being poisoned](./blood/pics/2020-03-09_messenger.png)

My symptoms for the next 24 hours lead me to belive that I was only in the [200-400ppm zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide_poisoning#Acute_poisoning). I am thankful that I was not working alone, and my lab partner helped me clean up and put things away. I walked home and had difficulties deciding whether or not to take my nightly medications (which should have been a no brainer: don't, they lower blood pressure). The next morning I woke up hazy and gave a very hazy presentation about pink capitalism in the gender neutral clothing industry and continued on with life without further complications.

Take away: don't work very late at night, and if you do make sure you have the right setup with extra stages to prevent backflow accidents.

Sadly, due to SARS-CoV-2, this lab space was shut down the next day and I was unable to retrieve my samples. All that for naught as the carbon monoxide treated samples were not distinguishable by eye.

Cut coagullated blood into cubes. Boil cubes for 15-20 minutes - when the blood cubes start to float, cut in half an check to make sure the middle is set before setting aside. Melt pig fat/butter in a non-stick pan and sweat half of a chopped onion until slightly translucent. Transfer blood cubes to pan. Sprinkle with red pepper, ground pepper and marjoram. Mix well. Generously add salt to taste. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Mix to coat and add other half of chopped onion. Again, generously add salt to taste. Cook until onions are soft, serve with fresh bread.

#### Swedish Blodpudding

> "a staple in Swedish schools growing up, usually served with lingonberry and taters" [Johan Edstrom](https://www.chefsteps.com/forum/posts/cooking-with-blood-7)
 
2 kg (enough for 12 servings, serving portion 150 g)
1 liter of pig blood
50 mL soft drink or light beer
80 dL coarse rye flour
1 yellow onion, chopped
150 g butter
1 tbsp salt
½ teaspoon ground cloves
1 ½ teaspoon ground spice
1 ½ teaspoon ground white pepper
2 teaspoons dried marjoram or thyme
½ cup syrup

To the molds:

butter
breadcrumbs

You also need:

2 molds, 1 ½ liter
greaseproof

Thaw the blood in the refrigerator for 8-10 hours. Preheat oven to 200 °.

Strain the blood and mix it with a weak drink or beer. Add the rye flour under heavy whipping. Mash the onion in a little of the butter and mix in the butter. Then melt the rest of the butter and mix down. Add salt, carnation and pepper. Crumble down the herb spice and pour in the syrup.

Fry a sample of batter in not too hot frying pan and taste. Adjust the seasoning if necessary.

Pour batter into greased bread pans up to 2/3 of the way. Cover the batter with buttered parchment paper. Place bread pans on a baking sheet with walls. After inserting the two pans on the baking pan into the oven, pour boiling water into the baking sheet. Bake in the water bath for 60-75 minutes.

If a knife comes out clean, the pudding is ready. Allow the pudding to cool slightly before stirring.

The blood pudding can be served freshly baked or stored in the refrigerator for a few days. It can also be frozen and stored in the freezer for up to 3 months.

Tip 2: The batter can also be used for pancakes: Melt fat in a frying pan or plate. Add 1 tablespoon batter to each plate and bake them on both sides on not too strong heat.

0.2 g cardamom seeds

Toast, crush, wrap in a muslin satchel

690 g UHT heavy cream (you want the cream that contains stabilizers like carageenan)

Heat cream to 70 °C, add spice satchel and let infuse while the cream cools to room temperature.

160 g pig's blood

Combine pigs blood with cream, and reduce the mixture at or below 70 °C until very thick. This is easiest to do with a Thermomix with a whisk attachement, but it can be done in an uncovered container in a water bath (stirring frequently). The thickness should reach the consistency of a puree. It takes a while. So long as the temperature stays below 70 °C, you will get a very smooth texture (none of the gritiness that you associate with blood puddings and such).

Season the thickened mixture with sugar and salt to taste. It can be refrigerated and reheated later, so long as you use the stabilized UHT cream.

##### Sanguinaccio Dolce by Peter Bella

1- pint of whole milk

1- pint of fresh or frozen (thawed) pig’s blood (Unless you live near a slaughter house, you will only find commercial pig or frozen pig blood. It is coagulated. Place it in a blender or food processor before using. If you have an immersion blender you can process the blood on low speed as it melts in the double boiler)

12 oz. - dark chocolate (at least 70% cocoa), broken into small pieces

1 pound- sugar

1/2 tsp- vanilla

Cinnamon, optional (Five spice powder can be substituted for a range of spice flavor)

Grated rind of 1 orange, optional (Orange and chocolate marry very well)

Though not traditional, you can add a bit of heat with a pinch or two of cayenne pepper. Chocolate and hot pepper go very well together.

In a double boiler, heat water until simmering. On medium heat, heat the milk and and sugar together until sugar is dissolved, stirring. (A double boiler can be made using a large pot, filled about one third and a mixing bowl inserted in the top. The water should not touch the bottom of the bowl. See Illustration.)

Stir in vanilla.

Add the dark chocolate and stir until it is melted.

Add the pig blood and stir. If blood is coagulated, use an immersion blender on low to help dissolve it.

Stir constantly. As the dolce cooks, the mixture will begin to thicken like a custard.

Add the cinnamon and orange rind (if using) and mix in thoroughly.

Cook until the mixture has a custard or pudding like consistency.

Remove from heat. Serve immediately or cool, letting it set up into a pudding.

#### Paltbröd (2008)

5 cups of pig blood
2.5 dl water
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons light syrup
50 grams of yeast
1 teaspoon salt
8 dl wheat flour
1.2 liters of rye flour

Bring blood to room temp.
Heat water to 70C in a large saucepan, add butter. When butter is melted, remove from heat.
Strain the blood and whisk it into the mixture.
The mixture should now be 37 degrees or roughly body temperature. If it's cooled too much, gently heat while stirring.
Take 1 cup of the mixture and place in a large dough bowl and crumble the yeast. Stir to combine.
Add the rest of the blood water, salt and syrup.
Stir in 70mL of wheat flour (save ~10mL) and all of the rye flour. Combine until smooth dough forms. Put in a slightly oiled bowl and cover for ~50 minutes.
Knead dough lightly.
Divide into six parts and shape each section into to a large round cake about 17 cm in diameter.
Place cakes on two greased oven plates (or alternatively, use parchment paper).
Cut them into wedge shaped pieces. Cover and let sit for another 30 minutes. Preheat at oven at 200C.
Bake bread for 20 minutes. Switching the pans to different racks halfway can help with even browning.
Remove from oven and let cool while covered with a black cloth. Bread is now ready and can be eaten.

To dry your bread, place them on cookie racks in an oven set to ~90C degrees for a few hours to overnight. Throughout the process, prop the door open slightly for a few minutes.

Bread freezes well. Suggestion: serve with pork and a white sauce.

# Draft Content

(everything below this is a DRAFT)

## But does it Taste Good?

In short, yes. For many of the recipies people couldn't tell they were eating blood. Even when I told them their was a "weird" ingridient, no one has sucessfully guessed blood yet.

That said, too much blood is *not* a good thing. Especially in baked goods. There was definitely a learning curve to figuring out how much blood each dish could "handle."

> I feel like this bread would taste good if I made bread with way too much blood and then I made this. It would definitely be better than the bread with way too much blood! [Mei-lan]

### The Gross Factor

> "these taste experiments in the field made us reflect on how crucial it is to not forget about all the “normal people” out there. Whether it’s about them having different tastes or a less-strong attraction to the new and unusual compared to the people in our immediate surroundings is a big question worth thinking about. What is usual here at the Lab is often weird and disgusting for many folks out there. Doing what we do is exciting and fun, at times both dippy and inspiring – but if we fail to reach out and convince others unlike us to at least give some of these foods a try, what is the point in the long run?" - [A side of bee larva with your afternoon coffee?](https://web.archive.org/web/20200419022305/http://nordicfoodlab.org/blog/2014/2/a-side-of-bee-larva-with-your-afternoon-coffee) by Edith Salminen at Nordic Food Labs

Similar to the first few times I handled raw meat, my initial encountors working with blood were slightly nauseating. That feeling quickly faded, but elephant in the room can't be ignored. The Gross Factor(tm) is definitely something that was on the mind of many of my recipie and taste testers.

> "I was really expecting to be grossed out, but then it was... fine. I thought it'd be thick but it wasn't. It was just like cooking with wine" - Alex, a recipe tester



I've been banned from talking about blood at home.

> "Cooking with blood is probably the least kosher activity in existence" - Ash



Blood. It's in meat, many people eat it all the time. And yet, for many the thought of eating something where blood upstages meat triggers a visceral discussed response. I tackle this problem continually in the recipes above, many of the ingredients and techniques are employed in an attempt to downplay or soft and the taste of blood. Why is this so? Why do we not like blood?









## Legality of Blood Consumption

### Iron

#### How much do you need?

>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of products within the context of a total diet. The **DV for iron is 18 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older**. FDA requires food labels to list iron content. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet.


|Age|Male|Female|Pregnancy|Lactation|
|------|-------|--------|--------------|-----------|
|Birth to 6 months|	0.27 mg*|	0.27 mg*		|
|7–12 months	|11 mg|	11 mg		|
|1–3 years	    |7 mg	|7 mg	|	
|4–8 years	    |10 mg	|10 mg	|	
|9–13 years	|8 mg	|8 mg	|	
|14–18 years	|11 mg	|15 mg	|27 mg	|10 mg
|19–50 years	|8 mg	|18 mg	|27 mg	|9 mg
|51+ years	|8 mg	|8 mg	|	
Table 1: Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Iron ($*$Adequate Intake (AI))

#### How much is too much?

> Ingestion of less than 20 mg/kg of elemental iron is non-toxic. Ingestion of 20 mg/kg to 60 mg/kg results in moderate symptoms. Ingestion of more than 60 mg/kg can result in severe toxicity and lead to severe morbidity and mortality.^[Yuen HW, Becker W. Iron Toxicity. [Updated 2019 Oct 30]. In: StatPearls [Internet]. Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls Publishing; 2020 Jan-. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459224/]

Even as a 4 year old AMAB^[Assigned Male at Birth] child (16kg)^[https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/data/set1clinical/cj41l021.pdf] taking two iron supplements a day (2x33mg, which is already *way* too much), you'd need to eat 3 1/2 loaves of bread, 1 1/2 *batches* of sanguinnacio dulce, or 50 crepes to get to the toxic realm. I think you'll be fine but don't push it, okay?

To get the equivalent of an Iron only supplement (360% of the reccomended daily intake), you'd need to eat *alot* of the food described here. Think of these recipies as a way prevent anemia rather than a way to come back from it. ""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" really resonates here. The hope is that these recipies are a fun and easy way to bump up your iron intake, avoid the need for supplements and reduce iron supplement associated gastrointestional issues^[Iron-only supplements usually deliver more than the DV, with many providing 65 mg iron (360% of the DV). Frequently used forms of iron in supplements include ferrous and ferric iron salts, such as ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, ferric citrate, and ferric sulfate. Because of its higher solubility, ferrous iron in dietary supplements is more bioavailable than ferric iron. High doses of supplemental iron (45 mg/day or more) may cause gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea and constipation. Other forms of supplemental iron, such as heme iron polypeptides, carbonyl iron, iron amino-acid chelates, and polysaccharide-iron complexes, might have fewer gastrointestinal side effects than ferrous or ferric salts.^[https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-%20HealthProfessional/#en28]]
#### Absorption
Some foods promote the absorption of iron, some prevent it. Here's a list!
